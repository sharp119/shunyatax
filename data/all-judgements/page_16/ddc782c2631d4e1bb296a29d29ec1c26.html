ITA No.93/Ahd/2011 for the A.Y.2004-05. This tax appeal was<br />
admitted vide order passed by this Court dated 19th July, 2012<br />
on the following substantial question of law;<br />
“Whether the Hon&#8217;ble ITAT has erred in not taking<br />
cognizance of the latest amendment in the nature of the<br />
proviso to section 2(15) of the I.T. Act inserted with effect<br />
from 01/04/2009?”<br />
Page 4 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
8. The facts giving rise to this tax appeal may be<br />
summarized as under;<br />
8.1 The assessee, namely, Gujarat Cricket Association (for<br />
short “the GCA”) is a society registered under the Societies<br />
Registration Act, 1860. The GCA came to be registered with<br />
the Registrar of Societies vide the Registration Certificate<br />
dated 10th July, 1984. Later, the GCA was notified under<br />
Section 10(23) of the Act, 1961 vide notification dated 30th<br />
March, 1999 from A.Y. 1999-2000 to 2001-2002 by the<br />
Government of India, Ministry of Finance, Department of<br />
Revenue.<br />
8.2 In the absence of renewal of the notification under<br />
Section 10(23) of the Act, the GCA preferred an application for<br />
registration under Section 12AA of the Act, 1961. The<br />
registration under Section 12AA of the Act came to be granted<br />
by the DIT (Exemption), Ahmedabad vide its order dated 16th<br />
April, 2003, i.e., from A.Y.2004-05 onwards.<br />
8.3 A show-cause notice dated 26th September, 2010 came<br />
to be issued upon the GCA under Section 12AA(3) of the Act,<br />
calling upon the GCA to show cause why the registration<br />
granted under Section 12AA of the Act should not be cancelled<br />
from 2004-05 onwards.<br />
8.4 The Commissioner, after hearing the assessee,<br />
cancelled the registration under Section 12AA for the period<br />
from A.Ys.2004-05 till the date of his order, i.e. 6th December,<br />
2010 in exercise of his powers under Section 12AA(3) by<br />
invoking the Proviso to Section 2(15) of the Act, 1961 inserted<br />
by the Finance Act, 2010 with effect from 1st April, 2009. The<br />
Page 5 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
Commissioner, while cancelling the registration of the assessee<br />
held that the activities of the trust were commercial in nature.<br />
The relevant observations in the order passed by the Director<br />
of Income Tax (Exemption), Ahmedabad are quoted herein<br />
below;<br />
“The legislature in its wisdom has introduced section<br />
12AA of the I.T. Act, 1961 by the Finance Act No.2, 1996<br />
w.e.f 1.4.1997 i.e. A.Y.1997-98 onwards which requires<br />
the Commissioner to be satisfied with the objects of the<br />
Trust and the genuineness of its activities. As a logical<br />
corollary of the provisions of Section 12AA of the Act, the<br />
Commissioner has to examine the objects of the Trust by<br />
their reference to the definition of “charitable purpose”<br />
along with the newly inserted proviso to charitable<br />
purpose in Section 2(15) of the Act w.e.f 1.4.2009. In fact<br />
there is a mutual, symbiotic relationship between the two<br />
provisions, namely section 2(15) and section 12AA of the<br />
I.T. Act, 1961. The definition of “charitable purpose” in<br />
section 2(15) of the Act is the engine which drives the<br />
machinery of the provisions of Section 12AA of the Act.<br />
Thus it is clear that even as per pre-amended section<br />
2(15) of the I.T. Act, the GCA is not entitled for<br />
registration u/s 12A of the I.T. Act as per ratio of<br />
judgments of Hon. Courts as discussed above. When this<br />
is the position even as per pre-amended section 2(15) of<br />
the I.T. Act, there remains no case at all for continuation<br />
of registration u/s 12A after the amendment of section<br />
2(15) by Finance Act 2008 as applicable from A.Y.2009-<br />
10 which, inter alia, clearly applicable to sports<br />
associations and is not applicable to educational<br />
institutions. In view of this, registration allowed to GCA<br />
u/s 12A of the I.T. Act stands withdrawn from A.Y.2004-<br />
05 onwards.<br />
The Ld. Counsel has further submitted that GCA has no<br />
contract with any party from which the funds are credited<br />
by BCCI coupled with the fact that GCA has no<br />
enforceable rights to receive any portion of TV rights<br />
which have been received by BCCI and the corpus<br />
donation received at the sweet will of BCCI may be in<br />
furtherance of the objects of that Institution namely BCCI.<br />
Page 6 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
I am constrained to state that there is no merit in the<br />
argument of the Id. Counsel. It goes without saying that<br />
BCCI is a huge money spinning machine in the field of<br />
Cricket. It is following practice of giving some portion of<br />
its TV rights to certain Cricket Associations in the country<br />
including the GCA. BCCI also has commercial<br />
transactions like receipts of TV rights, IPL matches etc.<br />
This commercial chain further percolates down to the<br />
State Associations like GCA which shows the receipts of<br />
TV rights as corpus donations. This accounting procedure<br />
is incorrect as it is purely commercial receipt which falls<br />
within the ambit and scope of newly inserted proviso to<br />
section 2(15) of the I.T. Act w.e.f. 1/4/2009. It partakes<br />
the character of tax avoidance device clearly attracting<br />
the decision of Constitution Bench (5 Judges) of the Apex<br />
Court in McDowell and Co. Ltd. Vs. CTO (1985) 154 ITR<br />
148 (SC) which fortifies the cancellation of registration of<br />
GCA. In this landmark case, their Lordships have held<br />
that tax planning may be legitimate provided it is within<br />
the framework of law. Colourable devices cannot be part<br />
of tax planning (Per Ranganath Misra at Pg.171 of the<br />
order).<br />
A critical analysis of Receipts and Expenditure of GCA<br />
shows that there Is huge generation of income of<br />
Rs.16,37,747.54, (-) Rs.70,50,486.28 and (-)<br />
Rs.5,91,708.94 in F.Ys. 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09<br />
respectively after meeting out only a nominal<br />
expenditure on promotion of sports of Rs.67,76,530/-,<br />
Rs.15,16,311/and Rs.24,90,579/ in F.Y.2006-07, 2007-08<br />
and 2008-09 respectively. There is capital expenditure of<br />
Rs. 11,37,64,313/~, Rs.6,63,80,215.80 and<br />
Rs.1,99,23,701/ in F.Y. 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09<br />
respectively. It is reiterated that this capital expenditure<br />
cannot be considered as charitable expenditure for<br />
promotion of sports as It is simply an act of business<br />
organization to enhance its Infrastructure and income<br />
earning apparatus. Thus the expenditure on promotion of<br />
sports as percentage .of total receipts has further<br />
declined further in F.Y.2008-09. If GCA was really a<br />
charitable organization, it should have acted as such and<br />
instead of earning huge income, it should have ensured<br />
as under:<br />
(a) There should have been no ticket for watching cricket<br />
Page 7 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
matches so that more and more youth, students and<br />
common man are able to watch these matches. Instead<br />
there are costly tickets for general public for watching<br />
these important Cricket Matches and true to its character<br />
as an out and out commercial organisation.<br />
(b) GCA should have allowed the free use of its Cricket<br />
ground for conducting tournaments and also popularizing<br />
the game of Cricket in the state of Gujarat for the<br />
common man.<br />
viii) It is further seen from the Auditor’s Report for F.Y.<br />
2006-07 dated 20/8/07 (Page 2), 2007-08 dated 11/8/98<br />
(Page 11) and 2008-09 dated 23/7/09 (Page 7) that TV<br />
rights received from BCCI are amounting to<br />
Rs.17,58,00,000/-,Rs.6,83,46,038/ and Rs.20,69,60,338/-<br />
respectively have been shown as CORPUS. The<br />
accounting practice followed by GCA by treating TV rights<br />
received from BCCI as corpus is incorrect. This is purely<br />
a commercial receipt which falls within the ambit and<br />
scope of aforesaid proviso to section 2(15) of the I.T. Act,<br />
1961.<br />
From the above discussion, it is quite clear that there is<br />
huge generation of revenue of Rs.2,52,96,831/-,<br />
Rs.1,80,04,862/- and RS.3,98,07,027/- in F.Ys.2006-07,<br />
2007-08 and 2008-09 respectively after meeting out<br />
small expenditure on promotion of Sports of<br />
Rs.67,76,530/-, Rs.15,16,311/- and Rs.24,90,796/- in<br />
F.Ys.2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09 respectively giving a<br />
percentage of expenditure on promotion of Sports at<br />
26.78%, 8.42% and 6.25% for the aforesaid three<br />
financial years respectively. In other words, GCA is not<br />
spending much of the revenue generated for the<br />
promotion of Sports. This is a clear violation of the<br />
educative object of GCA as is seen from the<br />
submission of the Id. Counsel above.<br />
From the reasons mentioned above, it is quite manifestly<br />
and palpably evident that the entire character and focus<br />
of GCA has become totally commercial with the object of<br />
earning revenue and it is no more a charitable<br />
organization. As stated above, the facts and ratio of the<br />
decision of the Uttarakhand High Court in the case of<br />
Queens’ Educational Society (supra) call for withdrawal of<br />
registration allowed to GCA u/s 12AA of the I.T. Act, 1961<br />
Page 8 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
even with pre-amended section 2(15) of the I.T. Act,<br />
1961. Furthermore, a fortiori, with the amendment u/s<br />
2(15) of the I.T. Act, 1961 by the Finance Act, 2008 w.e.f.<br />
A.Y.2009~10, GCA has lost the status of charitable<br />
organisation. Its activities, proprio vigore, are being<br />
carried on commercial lines. GCA, though, was granted<br />
registration in principle by this Office Order dated<br />
16/4/03, did not carry out any activity which has<br />
charitable object and also by invoking Doctrine of Just<br />
Cause in the light of the observations of Hon Supreme<br />
Court in 259 ITR, 1 (SC) (supra), I strongly conclude that<br />
the activities of GCA are not genuine charities and are<br />
being carried out with Pure commercial considerations<br />
bereft of any element of charity. Accordingly, the<br />
registration granted earlier vide this Office Order dated<br />
16.4.2003 is cancelled w.e.f 16.4.2003 i.e. A.Y.2004-05<br />
onwards.”<br />
8.5 The assessee, being dissatisfied with the order passed<br />
by the Director of Income Tax (Exemption), cancelling the<br />
registration, preferred an appeal before the Income Tax<br />
Appellate Tribunal, &#8216;A&#8217; Bench, Ahmedabad. The ITAT allowed<br />
the appeal preferred by the GCA. While allowing the appeal,<br />
the ITAT observed as under;<br />
“We have considered the rival submissions, perused the<br />
material on record and have gone through the orders of<br />
authorities below and the tribunal decision cited by the<br />
Ld. A.R. In the present case, the registration of the<br />
assessee was cancelled by the DIT(E) on this basis that<br />
the main source of income of the assessee is derived<br />
form sponsorship, bank interest, annual subscription,<br />
income from ICC matches, income from<br />
trophy/tournament matches, scrap sale, rental income<br />
and sale of tickets. It is observed by him that none of<br />
these sources of income has any nexus with the<br />
education of the cricketers. He also observed that in fact,<br />
the assessee has been engaged itself in transaction of<br />
commercial nature. He also observed that the assessee<br />
has been carrying its activities with a commercial motive.<br />
He has decided the issue on this basis that as per the<br />
amended provisions of Section 2(15) of the Income Tax<br />
Page 9 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
Act, 1961. In the case of Vidarbha Cricket Association<br />
(supra) also, registration was cancelled u/s.12AA(3) of<br />
the Act on the basis of amended provisions of Section<br />
2(15) of the Act and under these facts, the issue has<br />
been decided by the tribunal in favour of the assessee.<br />
The relevant para is para 7, 8 &#038; 9 of the Tribunal<br />
decision which are reproduced below:<br />
“7. In this view of the matter, we may now examine the<br />
reasons put forth by the Commissioner in this case to<br />
cancel registration already granted to the assessee under<br />
section 12A of the Act. In this direction, we have carefully<br />
perused the impugned order, wherein the Commissioner<br />
has primarily examined the application of revised<br />
definition of charitable purpose under section 2(15) as<br />
amended by the Finance Act, 2003 with effect from<br />
1.4.2009. The ultimate conclusion of the Commissioner in<br />
paragraph 17 of the impugned order is pertinent, which<br />
is reproduced as under-<br />
&#8220;17. In view of the amended provisions of sec. 2(15), it Is<br />
seen that assessee’s activities can no longer be regarded<br />
as charitable activities. Especially the proviso to sec.<br />
2(15) is violated by assessee and hence, it cannot be<br />
regarded as a charitable society engaged In charitable<br />
purposes. I have duly considered the nature of activities,<br />
the sources of income, the activities on which<br />
expenditure was made, surplus generated existence of<br />
profit motive, commercial exploitation of assets, fees and<br />
Charges collected, nature of other income and other<br />
activities and case law before coming to a final<br />
conclusion, the assessee Vidarbha Cricket Association<br />
cannot be held to be an organization meant for charitable<br />
purposes in view of the above findings.<br />
18. In the result, the deemed registration benefit under<br />
section 12AA as claimed and enjoyed by the assessee is<br />
hereby withdrawn/cancelled from assessment year 2009-<br />
10 onwards.<br />
8. On a perusal of the aforesaid, It is clearly<br />
established that as per the Commissioner, the activities<br />
of the assessee do not qualify to fall within the meaning<br />
of charitable purpose as per proviso to section 2(15)<br />
inserted with effect from 1.4.2009. Quite clearly, as we<br />
have observed earlier, such an objection cannot be the<br />
Page 10 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
basis of invoke section 12AA(3) so as to cancel the<br />
registration already granted to the assessee under<br />
section 12A of the Act. In our considered opinion<br />
registration already granted to the assessee could not<br />
have been re-visited by the Commissioner on the basis of<br />
the reasoning aforesaid, since his power to cancel<br />
registration under section 12AA(3) was confined to the<br />
examination as to whether the activities of the assessee<br />
society/association are genuine or that the same are not<br />
being carried out in accordance with the stated objects.<br />
In the light of the discussion emerging form the order of<br />
the Commissioner in our considered opinion, action taken<br />
by the Commissioner does not fall within the parameters<br />
of section 12AA(3) of the Act and, therefore, the<br />
impugned order is bad in law.<br />
9. At this stage, we may hasten to add that we are not<br />
commenting on the merits of the issue as to whether the<br />
activities of the assessee fall within the meaning of<br />
expression charitable purpose as per section 2(15) as<br />
amended with effect from 1.4.2009. The only point<br />
decided in the appeal is to the effect that it was not<br />
within the scope and ambit of section 12AA(3) for the<br />
Commissioner to have examined the applicability of the<br />
amended section 2(15) of the purposes of invoking his<br />
powers of cancellation provided in section 12AA(3) of the<br />
Act. At this stage, we may also state that the issues<br />
raised by the Commissioner in the impugned order are<br />
not beyond the powers of the revenue to examine, so<br />
however, the same can only be examined in the<br />
appropriate proceedings, such as assessment<br />
proceedings in the present case. Our decision is resting<br />
only on the foundation that the impugned order passed<br />
by the Commissioner is not permissible in view of the<br />
limited powers available to him under section 12AA(3) of<br />
the Act. However it would be open for the A.O. to<br />
consider the issues raised in the impugned order, if so<br />
advised, in the course of the relevant assessment<br />
proceedings.&#8221;<br />
5. Since the present case also, registration has been<br />
cancelled by DIT(E) on the basis of amended provisions<br />
of Section 2(15) of the Income tax Act,1961, we are of<br />
the considered opinion that the action taken by DIT(E)<br />
does not fall within the permissible limits of Section<br />
12AA(3) of the Income tax Act, 1961 and therefore, the<br />
Page 11 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
impugned order is bad in law. We also add that we are<br />
not commenting on the merits of the issue as to whether<br />
the activities of the assessee falls within the meaning of<br />
charitable purpose as per Section 2(15) of the Income tax<br />
Act, 1961 as amended and we are only deciding this<br />
aspect of matter that the order passed by the DIT(E) u/s<br />
12AA(3) is bad in law. This issue raised by the DIT(E) is<br />
not permissible in view of the limited powers available to<br />
him U/s. 12AA(3) of the Income tax Act, 1961. However,<br />
it would be open for the A.O. to consider all the issues<br />
raised in the impugned order, if so advised, in the course<br />
of relevant assessment proceedings<br />
6. In view of our discussion in the above para, we set<br />
aside the order of DIT(E) u/s. 12AA(3) of the Income Tax<br />
Act, 1961 and restore the registration granted to the<br />
assessee u/s.12A of the Income tax Act, 1961.”<br />
8.6 The Revenue, being dissatisfied with the order passed<br />
by the ITAT has come up with the present appeal.<br />
Submissions on behalf of the Revenue:-<br />
9. Mr. M.R. Bhatt, the learned senior counsel appearing for<br />
the Revenue vehemently submitted that the ITAT committed a<br />
serious error in disturbing the order passed by the Director of<br />
Income Tax (Exemption), cancelling the registration of the GCA<br />
under Section 12AA of the Act. According to Mr. Bhatt, in view<br />
of the amendment under Section 2(15) of the Act, the DIT<br />
(Exemption) was justified in taking the view that the activities<br />
of the GCA cannot be termed as charitable and such activities<br />
were commercial in nature with the element of earning profit<br />
from the income of sale of tickets, income from the ICC,<br />
income from hosting the international cricket matches etc. Mr.<br />
Bhatt would submit that the DIT (Exemption) was justified in<br />
taking the view that though the BCCI confirmed the payment<br />
to the assessee as grant of subsidy, the same was not in the<br />
Page 12 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
nature of grant. Mr. Bhatt would submit that most of the<br />
advertisements through TV telecasting are received by the<br />
BCCI, it being the apex body,thus the so-called subsidy given<br />
by the BCCI is nothing but some sort of sharing of the<br />
advertisement income on account of holding of international<br />
test matches and one-day international matches, due to which,<br />
the BCCI has amassed huge advertisement income. Mr. Bhatt<br />
would submit that the nature of receipt, even though called<br />
subsidy by the assessee, was necessarily in the nature of<br />
income received by the activity of the assessee.<br />
10. Referring to Section 12AA(3) read with Section 2(15) of<br />
the Act, 1961, Mr. Bhatt submitted that even if the activities<br />
were carried on in accordance with the arrangement with the<br />
other party,the activities, being not charitable, it was hit by<br />
Section 12AA(3) of the Act, 1961. Reading genuineness into<br />
the activities of the trust and considering the objects of the<br />
trust, Mr. Bhatt submitted that the term “genuineness” has<br />
been used only to find out whether the institution was<br />
charitable or not. Once the institution was held as not for<br />
charitable purpose, Section 12AA registration came to be<br />
rightly cancelled by the DIT (Exemption).<br />
11. In such circumstances, referred to above, Mr. Bhatt prays<br />
that there being merit in this appeal, the same be allowed and<br />
the substantial question of law be answered in favour of the<br />
Revenue and against the assessee.<br />
Submissions on behalf of the respondent-assessee:<br />
12. On the other hand, this appeal has been vehemently<br />
opposed by Mr. J.P. Shah, the learned senior counsel appearing<br />
Page 13 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
for the GCA. Mr. Shah would submit that no error, not to speak<br />
of any error of law, could be said to have been committed by<br />
the ITAT in quashing and setting aside the order passed by the<br />
DIT (Exemption). Mr. Shah would submit that since the<br />
inception of the GCA and the date of grant of the registration<br />
under the Act, the objects of the Association have remained<br />
the same and have not undergone any change to question its<br />
genuineness. Mr. Shah would submit that the view of the DIT<br />
(Exemption) that the assessee could not be said to be carrying<br />
on the charitable activity as per Section 2(15) of the Act is<br />
erroneous in law. Mr. Shah would submit that in any event all<br />
that the Section 12AA(3) of the Act prescribes for cancellation<br />
is the genuineness of the activities of the trust or that the<br />
activities are not carried on in accordance with the objects of<br />
the trust.<br />
13. Mr. Shah took us through the various objects of the<br />
Association and pointed out to the clear distinct words used in<br />
Section12AA(1) and 12AA(3) of the Act as well as the first<br />
Proviso to Section 2(15) of the Act. Mr. Shah submitted that<br />
the grant of registration originally as early as in 2003 clearly<br />
indicates the satisfaction of the authorities that the assessee is<br />
a public charitable trust under Section 12AA of the Act. Mr.<br />
Shah would submit, referring to Section12AA(3) of the Act, that<br />
the cancellation of registration granted is permissible in law<br />
only under the following circumstances;<br />
(I) On the Commissioner recording his satisfaction that the<br />
activities of the trust are not genuine or are not being carried<br />
out in accordance with the objects of the trust or institution,;<br />
thus unless and until the show cause notice issued contained<br />
Page 14 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
the grounds and materials as prescribed under Section<br />
12AA(3) of the Act, the question of cancellation of registration,<br />
per se, does not arise.<br />
14. Mr. Shah, thereafter, took us through the Circular No.11<br />
of 2008 issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes dated 19th<br />
December, 2008. The circular was issued in the wake of the<br />
insertion of the Proviso to Section 2(15) of the Act, 1961. Mr.<br />
Shah would submit that from the reading of the circular, it is<br />
evident that the question of rejection of registration under<br />
Section 12AA(3) of the Act would arise only in those cases<br />
where an entity uses this status of charitable institution with a<br />
charitable object of general public utility as a mask or a device<br />
to hide the true purpose and that object is nothing other then<br />
trade, commerce or business or the rendering of any service in<br />
relation to trade, commerce or business. Mr. Shah would<br />
submit that in the case on hand, the Revenue has not been<br />
able to substantiate with any cogent material to indicate the<br />
absence of the genuineness of the activities. Mr. Shah would<br />
submit that the erroneous misconception in the mind of the<br />
Revenue is that by conduct of matches, the GCA could be said<br />
to have exhibited a sense of business or commercial character.<br />
In such circumstances, referred to above, Mr. Shah prays that<br />
there being no merit in this appeal, the same be dismissed and<br />
the substantial question of law, on which, this tax appeal has<br />
been admitted, may be answered in favour of the assessee<br />
and against the Revenue.<br />
15. Mr. Shah in support of his submissions, has placed<br />
strong reliance on a decision of the Madras High Court in the<br />
case of Tamil Nadu Cricket Association vs. Director of<br />
Page 15 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
Income Tax (Exemptions) &#038; Ors., (2014) 360 ITR 633<br />
(Mad.).<br />
16. Mr. Bhatt, the learned senior counsel appearing for the<br />
Revenue, in rejoinder, brought to the notice of this Court that<br />
the decision of the Madras High Court in the case of Tamil<br />
Nadu Cricket Association (supra), on which strong reliance is<br />
sought to be placed on behalf of the assessee, has been<br />
challenged by the Revenue before the Supreme Court . The<br />
Supreme Court is yet to hear the appeal preferred by the<br />
Revenue.<br />
ANALYSIS<br />
17. Having heard the learned counsel appearing for the<br />
parties and having gone through the materials on record, the<br />
only question that falls for our consideration is whether the<br />
ITAT committed any error in passing the impugned order.<br />
18. Section 12AA of the Act prescribes the procedure for<br />
registration. As per this, on receipt of the application for<br />
registration, the Commissioner is to call for such documents or<br />
information from the trust or institution in order to satisfy<br />
himself about the genuineness of the activities of the trust or<br />
institution. The Section further empowers the Commissioner to<br />
make such enquiry as he deems necessary in this regard. Once<br />
the Commissioner is satisfied or convinced about the objects of<br />
the trust or institution and the genuineness of the activities of<br />
the trust, he has to pass an order in writing registering the<br />
trust or institution; if he is not so satisfied, he has to pass an<br />
order in writing refusing to register the trust or institution.<br />
Page 16 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
19. Section 12AA(3) of the Act inserted with effect from<br />
01.10.2004 under the Finance (No.2) Act, 2004 and the<br />
amendment inserted by Finance Act, 2010, with effect from<br />
01.06.2010 therein empowering the Commissioner to cancel<br />
the registration granted under the stated circumstances, reads<br />
as under:-<br />
“Provision inserted under Finance Act, 2004:<br />
Section 12AA(3):- Where a trust or an institution has<br />
been granted registration under clause (b) of sub-section<br />
(1) and subsequently the Commissioner is satisfied that<br />
the activities of such trust or institution are not genuine<br />
or are not being carried out in accordance with the<br />
objects of the trust or institution, as the case may be, he<br />
shall pass an order in writing cancelling the registration<br />
of such trust or institution.<br />
Provided that no order under this sub-section shall be<br />
passed unless such trust or institution has been given a<br />
reasonable opportunity of being heard.“<br />
20. After the amendment in the year 2010, Section 12AA(3)<br />
of the Income Tax Act reads as follows:<br />
&#8220;Section 12AA(3):- Where a trust or an institution has<br />
been granted registration under clause (b) of sub-section<br />
(1) or has obtained registration at any time under section<br />
12A as it stood before its amendment by the Finance<br />
(No.2) Act, 1996 (33 of 1996) and subsequently the<br />
Commissioner is satisfied that the activities of such trust<br />
or institution are not genuine or are not being carried out<br />
in accordance with the objects of the trust or institution,<br />
as the case may be, he shall pass an order in writing<br />
cancelling the registration of such trust or institution:<br />
Provided that no order under this sub-section shall be<br />
passed unless such trust or institution has been given a<br />
reasonable opportunity of being heard.&#8221;<br />
21. Thus in contrast to Section 12AA(1)(b) of the Income Tax<br />
Act, 1961, where the grant of registration requires the<br />
Page 17 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
satisfaction about the objects of the trust as well as the<br />
genuineness of the activities, for the cancellation of the<br />
registration under Section 12AA(3), all that it is insisted upon is<br />
the satisfaction as to whether the activities of the trust or<br />
institution are genuine or not and whether the activities are<br />
being carried on in accordance with the objects of the trust.<br />
Thus, even if the trust is a genuine one i.e., the objects are<br />
genuine, if the activities are not genuine and the same not<br />
being carried on in accordance with the objects of the trust,<br />
this will offer a good ground for cancellation. Thus, in every<br />
case, the grant of registration as well as the cancellation of<br />
registration rests on the satisfaction of the Commissioner on<br />
findings given on the parameters given in Sections 12AA(1)<br />
and 12AA(3) of the Act, as the case may be.<br />
22. The registration of the trust under the Act, confers certain<br />
benefits from taxation under the provisions of the Act. The<br />
conditions under which the income of the trust would be<br />
exempted under the provisions of the Act are clearly laid down<br />
under Section 11 as well as in Section 12 of the Act. Section 11<br />
of the Act specifically points out the circumstances under<br />
which the income of the trust is not to be included in the total<br />
income of the previous year of the person. So too, Section 12<br />
of the Act on the income derived from the property held for the<br />
charitable or religious purposes.<br />
23. Thus, when the assessee is in receipt of income from the<br />
activities, which fits in with Sections 11 and 12 of the Act as<br />
well as from the sources which do not fall strictly with the<br />
objects of the trust, would not go for cancellation of<br />

C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
registration under Section 12AA of the Act on the sole ground<br />
that the assessee is in receipt of income which does not qualify<br />
for exemption straight away by itself. All that ultimately would<br />
arise in such cases is the question of considering whether<br />
Section 11 of the Act would at all apply to exempt these<br />
income from liability. These are matters of assessment and has<br />
nothing to do with the genuineness of the activity or the<br />
activities not in conformity with the objects of the trust. As<br />
rightly pointed out by learned Senior counsel appearing for the<br />
assessee, as is evident from the reading of Circular No.11 of<br />
2008 dated 19.12.2008, the object of the insertion of the first<br />
proviso to Section 2(15) of the Act was only to curtail the<br />
institution, which under the garb of &#8216;general public utility&#8217;,<br />
carry on business or commercial activity only to escape the<br />
liability under the Act thereby gain unmerited exemption under<br />
Section 11 of the Act.<br />
24. The sum and substance of the submissions canvassed by<br />
Mr. J.P. Shah, the learned senior counsel appearing for the<br />
assessee, may be summed up thus;<br />
(I) The Gujarat Cricket Association is an affiliated member of<br />
the BCCI which controls and regulates all the cricket activities<br />
in India.<br />
(ii) The only source of income for the Gujarat Cricket<br />
Association is the receipt of some amount from the BCCI on<br />
account of the tournament subsidy.<br />
(iii) The Gujarat Cricket Association is a non-profit<br />
organization and applies its surplus for the promotion of the<br />
game of cricket, and that its objects prohibit the distribution of<br />
any surplus amongst its members.<br />
Page 19 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
(iv) All the members of the Executive Committee hold<br />
honorary position in the Gujarat Cricket Association.<br />
(v) The Gujarat Cricket Association has produced a number<br />
of excellent cricketers of international repute and the same<br />
was achieved by nurturing the talent irrespective of the cast,<br />
creed, status, religion etc. It also provides support to one<br />
another facet of the game of cricket, i.e. umpiring.<br />
(vi) The Gujarat Cricket Association has a self-sustaining<br />
model and promotes cricket in the State of Gujarat without any<br />
support, aid, grant or subsidy from any Government.<br />
(vii) The Gujarat Cricket Association has constructed a world<br />
class infrastructure facility by modernizing the entire Motera<br />
Stadium at Ahmedabad.<br />
(viii) The Gujarat Cricket Association provides medical aid to<br />
its players, remuneration to Coaches, Physiotherapists, Doctors<br />
etc.<br />
(ix) It organizes various programmes to encourage the game<br />
of cricket.<br />
(x) On the ground booking charges, it was submitted that<br />
only in the special cases, it has charged exclusively for the<br />
purpose of playing cricket matches.<br />
(xi) The Ranji Trophy and other matches are open to public<br />
viewing and no tickets are sold.<br />
(xii) On the international matches, charge is levied, but the<br />
same would be a nominal charge as it would be impossible to<br />
manage the affairs if the viewing is free of cost.<br />
25. The aforesaid indicates that there is no profit motive.<br />
Page 20 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
26. On income from the advertisement etc., it was submitted<br />
that the assessee has to maintain the stadium for the whole<br />
year and whereas, the international matches are played only<br />
once or twice in a year or may be in two years, the cost of<br />
maintenance of the stadium is as high as compared to the<br />
charges for transfer of interstate rights.<br />
27. All the funds are used for building up infrastructure for<br />
promotion of cricket and for the purpose of development of<br />
players and for the promotion of the game and no funds are<br />
being utilized for personal purpose of any of the members of<br />
the Association.<br />
28. The activities of the Association are not carried out on<br />
commercial basis.<br />
29. The Registration could not have been cancelled on an<br />
erroneous ground that the activities of the assessee are<br />
commercial in nature. For invoking Section 12AA read with<br />
Section 2(15) of the Act, the Revenue has to show that the<br />
activities are not in accordance with the objects of the<br />
Association.<br />
30. For achieving its main charitable object, if an institution<br />
carries on some commercial activity and there is profit, it<br />
cannot be considered to be a business activity, with profit<br />
motive, so long as, the profit earned is utilized for the purpose<br />
of achieving the main charitable object.<br />
Page 21 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
31. The sum and substance of the submissions canvassed on<br />
behalf of the Revenue may be summed up thus;<br />
(i) It is only logical to hold that the activities of the assessee<br />
are no longer falling within the definition of charitable<br />
purposes after the amendment of Section 2(15) of the Act w.e.f<br />
1st January, 2019.<br />
(ii) The assessee, in the name of general public utility, is<br />
engaged in business.<br />
(iii) Once the activities ceases to qualify as charitable, the<br />
same cannot be said to be genuine for the purpose of charity.<br />
(iv) Instead of promoting and developing the game of cricket,<br />
the assessee could be said to be promoting and developing the<br />
game of cricket as an entertainment and the tickets of the<br />
international matches are highly priced. The assessee, in such<br />
circumstances, could be said to have shifted the activities of<br />
the general public utility to commercial activity for generating<br />
revenue.<br />
32. We have gone through the entire judgment of the Madras<br />
High Court in the case of Tamil Nadu Cricket Association<br />
(supra). We are convinced with the line of reasoning assigned<br />
by the Madras High Court and the view taken on the subject. It<br />
is true that the decision of the Madras High Court has been<br />
challenged before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has<br />
yet to look into the issue and consider whether the view taken<br />
by the Madras High Court is the correct proposition of law or<br />
not?. However, as on date, the view taken by the Madras High<br />
Court on the subject holds the field. We may quote the<br />
Page 22 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
relevant observations made by the High Court of Madras.<br />
“Going by the objects , we find that the trust falls under<br />
the head of &#8220;any other object of general public utility&#8221;<br />
and hence falls within the meaning of charitable purpose<br />
under Section 2(15) of the Act. Section 2(15) of the Act<br />
defines &#8220;charitable purpose&#8221; as it originally stood at the<br />
time of grant of registration as under:-<br />
&#8221; &#8216;charitable purpose&#8217; includes relief of the poor,<br />
education, medical relief and the advancement of any<br />
other object of general public utility.&#8221;<br />
23. Section 2(15) was amended under Finance Act,2008,<br />
with effect form 1.4.2009 by substituting the following<br />
provision which reads s under:<br />
&#8220;2. Definitions. &#8230;. (15) &#8220;charitable purpose&#8221; includes<br />
relief of the poor, education, medical relief, preservation<br />
of environment (including waterheds, forests and wildlife)<br />
and preservation of monuments or places or objects of<br />
artistic or historic interest, and the advancement of any<br />
other object of general public utility.<br />
Provided that the advancement of any other object of<br />
general public utility shall not be a charitable purpose, if<br />
it involves the carrying on of any activity in the nature of<br />
trade, commerce or business, or any activity of rendering<br />
any service in relation to any trade, commerce or<br />
business, for a cess or fee or any other consideration,<br />
irrespective of the nature of use or application, or<br />
retention, of the income from such activity;)<br />
24. Section 2(15) as it stood prior to 1983 defined<br />
&#8216;charitable purpose&#8217; to include relief of the poor,<br />
education, medical relief, and the advancement of any<br />
other object of general public utility not involving the<br />
carrying on of any activity for profit. The phrase &#8220;not<br />
involving the carrying on of any activity for profit&#8221; was<br />
omitted from the Section by the Finance Act 1983, with<br />
effect from 01.04.1984, consequent on the amendment<br />
to Section 11, where under profits and gains of business<br />
in the case of charitable or religious trust and institutions<br />
would not be entitled to exemption under that Section,<br />
except in cases where the business fulfilled the<br />
conditions under Section 11 (4). The Section was once<br />
again amended by substitution in the year 2008 under<br />
Page 23 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
the Finance Act, 2008, with effect from 01.04.2009,<br />
streamlining the definition of &#8216;charitable purpose&#8217;,<br />
considering the fact that taking advantage of the phrase<br />
&#8216;advancement of any other object of general public<br />
utility&#8217;, number of entities operating on commercial lines<br />
claimed exemption on their income either under Section<br />
20(23c) or under Section 11 of the Act. Thus, to limit the<br />
scope of this expression, Section was amended in the<br />
year 2008 that the advancement of any other object of<br />
general public utility shall not be a charitable purpose, if<br />
the object involved the carrying on of any activity in the<br />
nature of trade, commerce or business, or any activity of<br />
rendering any service in relation to any trade, commerce<br />
or business, for a cess or fee or any other consideration,<br />
irrespective of the nature of use or application, or<br />
retention, of the income from such activity. Though the<br />
section as it stood prior to the substitution in 2008<br />
contained no provision as in the proviso under the 2008<br />
amendment, yet the Supreme Court held that that if the<br />
primary or dominant purpose of a trust or institution is<br />
charitable, another object which by itself may not be<br />
charitable but which is merely ancillary or incidental to<br />
the primary or dominant purpose would not prevent the<br />
trust or institution from being a valid charity: vide CIT v.<br />
Andhra Chamber of Commerce [1965] 55 ITR 722 (SC)<br />
(referred to in the decision reported in (1980) 121 ITR<br />
1(Addl. Commissioner of Income-tax v. Surat Art Silk<br />
Cloth Manufacturers Association). Thus if the dominant<br />
object or the primary object was charitable, the<br />
subsidiary object for the purpose of securing the<br />
fulfillment of the dominant object would not militate<br />
against its charitable character and the purpose would<br />
not be any the less charitable. The amendment in the<br />
year 2008 made a drastic amendment to deny the status<br />
of a charitable purpose to an institution with the object of<br />
general public utility, having any activity in the nature of<br />
trade, commerce or business, or any activity of rendering<br />
any service in relation to any trade, commerce or<br />
business, for a cess or fee or any other consideration.<br />
25. Proviso to Section 2(15) of the Income Tax Act states<br />
that if the objects involve the carrying on any activity in<br />
the nature of trade, commerce or business, for a cess or<br />
fee or any other consideration, irrespective of the nature<br />
of use or application, or retention, of the income from<br />
such activity, the status of the institution will not be one<br />
Page 24 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
for &#8216;charitable purpose&#8217;.<br />
26. The Central Board of Direct Taxes, in paragraph 3.2<br />
pointed out to the scope of the circular as under:-<br />
&#8221; In such a case, the object of &#8216;general public utility&#8217; will<br />
be only a mask or a device to hide the true purpose,<br />
which is trade, commerce or business or the rendering of<br />
any service in relation to trade, commerce or business.<br />
Each case would, therefore, be decided on its own facts<br />
and no generalization is possible. Assessees, who claim<br />
that their object is &#8216;charitable purpose&#8217; within the<br />
meaning of Section 2(15), would be well advised to<br />
eschew any activity which is in the nature of trade,<br />
commerce or business or the rendering of any service in<br />
relation to any trade, commerce or business.&#8221;<br />
27. Thus, the anxiety of the Parliament in introducing the<br />
proviso to Section 2(15) of the Act is only to check those<br />
institution, which attempt to gain exemption under the<br />
cloak of a trust.<br />
28. Section 11 of the Act states that income from<br />
property held for religious or charitable purposes shall<br />
not be included in the total income of the previous year.<br />
Section 12 deals with income of trusts or institutions from<br />
contributions. Section 12A deals with making application<br />
for registration of the trust/association so that the said<br />
institution will have the benefit of exemption under<br />
Section 11 and 12 of the Act.<br />
29. Section 12AA of the Act prescribes procedure for<br />
registration. As per this, on receipt of the application for<br />
registration, the Commissioner is to call for such<br />
documents or information from the trust or institution in<br />
order to satisfy himself about the genuineness of<br />
activities of the trust or institution. The Section further<br />
empowers the Commissioner to make such enquiry as he<br />
deems necessary in this regard. Once the Commissioner<br />
is satisfied himself about the objects of the trust or<br />
institution and the genuineness of the activities of the<br />
trust, he has to pass an order in writing registering the<br />
trust or institution; if he is not so satisfied, he has to pass<br />
an order in writing refusing to register the trust or<br />
institution.<br />
30. Section 12AA(3) of the Act inserted with effect from<br />
01.10.2004 under the Finance (No.2) Act, 2004 and the<br />
amendment inserted by Finance Act, 2010, with effect<br />
Page 25 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
from 01.06.2010 therein empowering the Commissioner<br />
to cancel the registration granted under the stated<br />
circumstances, reads as under:-<br />
Provision inserted under Finance Act, 2004:<br />
Section 12AA(3):- Where a trust or an institution has<br />
been granted registration under clause (b) of sub-section<br />
(1) and subsequently the Commissioner is satisfied that<br />
the activities of such trust or institution are not genuine<br />
or are not being carried out in accordance with the<br />
objects of the trust or institution, as the case may be, he<br />
shall pass an order in writing cancelling the registration<br />
of such trust or institution.<br />
Provided that no order under this sub-section shall be<br />
passed unless such trust or institution has been given a<br />
reasonable opportunity of being heard.<br />
31. After amendment in the year 2010, Section 12AA(3)<br />
of the Income Tax Act reads as follows:<br />
&#8220;Section 12AA(3):- Where a trust or an institution has<br />
been granted registration under clause (b) of sub-section<br />
(1) or has obtained registration at any time under section<br />
12A as it stood before its amendment by the Finance<br />
(No.2) Act, 1996 (33 of 1996) and subsequently the<br />
Commissioner is satisfied that the activities of such trust<br />
or institution are not genuine or are not being carried out<br />
in accordance with the objects of the trust or institution,<br />
as the case may be, he shall pass an order in writing<br />
cancelling the registration of such trust or institution:<br />
Provided that no order under this sub-section shall be<br />
passed unless such trust or institution has been given a<br />
reasonable opportunity of being heard.&#8221;<br />
32. Thus in contrast to Section 12AA(1)(b) of the Income<br />
Tax Act, 1961, where the grant of registration requires<br />
satisfaction about the objects of the trust as well as<br />
genuineness of the activities, for the cancellation of the<br />
registration under Section 12AA(3), all that it is insisted<br />
upon is the satisfaction as to whether the activities of the<br />
trust or institution are genuine or not and whether the<br />
activities are being carried on in accordance with the<br />
objects of the trust. Thus, even if the trust is a genuine<br />
one i.e., the objects are genuine, if the activities are not<br />
genuine and the same not being carried on in accordance<br />
with the objects of the trust, this will offer a good ground<br />
for cancellation. Thus, in every case, grant of registration<br />
Page 26 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
as well as cancellation of registration rests on the<br />
satisfaction of the Commissioner on findings given on the<br />
parameters given in Section 12AA(1) and 12AA(3) of the<br />
Act, as the case may be.<br />
33. Registration of the trust under the Act, confers<br />
certain benefits from taxation under the provisions of the<br />
Act. The conditions under which the income of the trust<br />
would be exempted under the provisions of the Act are<br />
clearly laid down under Section 11 as well as in Section<br />
12 of the Act. Section 11 of the Act specifically points out<br />
the circumstances under which income of the trust is not<br />
to be included in the total income of the previous year of<br />
the person. So too, Section 12 of the Act on the income<br />
derived from property held for charitable or religious<br />
purposes.<br />
34. Thus, when the assessee is in receipt of income from<br />
activities, which fits in with Sections 11 and 12 of the Act<br />
as well as from sources which do not fall strictly with the<br />
objects of the trust, would not go for cancellation of<br />
registration under Section 12AA of the Act on the sole<br />
ground that the assessee is in receipt of income which<br />
does not qualify for exemption straight away by itself. All<br />
that ultimately would arise in such cases is the question<br />
of considering whether Section 11 of the Act would at all<br />
apply to exempt these income from liability. These are<br />
matters of assessment and has nothing to do with the<br />
genuineness of the activity or the activities not in<br />
conformity with the objects of the trust. As rightly<br />
pointed out by learned Senior counsel appearing for the<br />
assessee, as is evident from the reading of Circular No.11<br />
of 2008 dated 19.12.2008, the object of the insertion of<br />
first proviso to Section 2(15) of the Act was only to curtail<br />
institution, which under the garb of &#8216;general public<br />
utility&#8217;, carry on business or commercial activity only to<br />
escape the liability under the Act thereby gain unmerited<br />
exemption under Section 11 of the Act.<br />
35. In the decision reported in (2012) 343 ITR 23 (Bom)<br />
(Sinhagad Technical Education Society V. Commissioner<br />
of Income Tax (Central), Pune &#038; Anr), the Bombay High<br />
Court held as follows:<br />
&#8220;As a result of the amendment, which has been brought<br />
about by the Finance Act of 2010, Subsection (3) of<br />
Section 12AA has been amended specifically to empower<br />
the Commissioner to cancel a registration obtained under<br />
Page 27 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
Section 12A as it stood prior to its amendment by the<br />
Finance (No.2) Act, 1996. SubSection (3) was inserted<br />
into the provisions of Section 12AA by the Finance (No.2)<br />
Act, 2004 with effect from 1 October 2004. As it originally<br />
stood, under subsection (3), a power to cancel<br />
registration was conferred upon the Commissioner where<br />
a trust or an institution had been granted registration<br />
under clause (b) of subsection (1) of Section 12AA. The<br />
Commissioner, after satisfying himself that the objects of<br />
the trust or an institution are not genuine or are not<br />
being carried out in accordance with the objects of the<br />
trust or institution, as the case may be, was vested with<br />
the power to pass an order in writing cancelling the<br />
registration of such trust or institution. By the Finance<br />
Act of 2010, subsection (3) was amended so as to<br />
empower the Commissioner to cancel the registration of<br />
a trust or an institution which has obtained registration at<br />
any time under Section 12A (as it stood before its<br />
amendment by the Finance (No.2) Act, 1996). As a result<br />
of the amendment, a regulatory framework is now sought<br />
to be put in place so as to cover also a trust or an<br />
institution which has obtained registration under Section<br />
12A as it stood prior to its amendment in 1996.<br />
&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..<br />
power under Section 12AA(3) can be exercised by the<br />
Commissioner in respect of a trust registered prior to 1<br />
June 2010. The mere fact that a part of the requisites for<br />
the action under Section 12AA (3) is drawn from a time<br />
prior to its passing namely registration as a charitable<br />
trust under Section 12A prior to 2010 would not make the<br />
amendment retrospective in operation. The amendment<br />
does not take away any vested right nor does it create<br />
new obligations in respect of past actions.&#8221;<br />
36. As already pointed out earlier, the question as to<br />
whether the particular income of trust is eligible for<br />
exemption under Section 12 of the Act is a matter of<br />
assessment and this Court had pointed out in the<br />
decision reported in 343 ITR 300 in the case of CIT Vs.<br />
Sarvodaya Ilakkiya Pannai, as under:-<br />
&#8221; In order to avail the benefit of exemption under Section<br />
11 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, a Trust can make an<br />
application to the Commissioner for registration under<br />
Section 12A of the Income Tax Act, 1961. On receipt of<br />
the said application for registration of a trust or<br />
Page 28 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
institution, the Commissioner should satisfy himself<br />
about the genuineness of the activities of the trust or<br />
institution. In order to satisfy himself, the Commissioner<br />
may also make such enquiry as he may deem necessary<br />
in that behalf. In the event the Commissioner satisfies<br />
himself that the trust is entitled to registration keeping in<br />
mind the objects, shall grant registration in writing in<br />
terms of Section 12AA(1)(b)(i) of the Income Tax Act,<br />
1961. In the event the Commissioner is not satisfied, he<br />
shall refuse such registration in terms of Section 12AA(1)<br />
(b)(ii) of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Once such a<br />
satisfaction is arrived at by the Commissioner to grant,<br />
such registration cannot be cancelled by following the<br />
very same provision of section 12AA(b)(i) of the Income<br />
Tax Act, 1961 to go into the genuineness of the activities<br />
of the trust. However, the Commissioner is empowered to<br />
revoke the certificate in terms of Section 12AA(3) of the<br />
Income Tax Act, 1961. As Commissioner is empowered to<br />
revoke the certificate in terms of section 12AA(3) of the<br />
Income Tax Act, 1961. As per the said provision, in the<br />
event the Commissioner is satisfied subsequently i.e.,<br />
after registration that the activities of such trust or<br />
institution are not genuine or not being carried out in<br />
accordance with the objects of the trust or the institution<br />
as the case may be, he shall pass an order in writing<br />
cancelling the registration of such trust or institution.&#8221;<br />
37. After the grant of registration, if the Commissioner is<br />
satisfied subsequently that the activities of the institution<br />
are not genuine or they are not carried on in accordance<br />
with the trust/ institution, he could pass an order in<br />
writing cancelling the registration of such trust or<br />
institution.<br />
38. Referring to Section 11 and 12A of the Act, this Court<br />
pointed out that the act of granting registration under<br />
Section 12AA(1) itself is a result of a satisfaction<br />
recorded by the Commissioner as regards the<br />
genuineness of the objects of the trust as well as the<br />
activities of the trust and once a satisfaction is arrived at<br />
by the Commissioner, the cancellation could only be in<br />
terms of Section 12AA(3) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.<br />
39. This Court pointed out that the cancellation made in<br />
the case of assessee therein was not on the ground that<br />
the activities were not genuine, but the activities of the<br />
trust in publication and sale and spread of Sarvodaya<br />
Page 29 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
Literature and Gandhian Ideologies was not the objects of<br />
the trust. This Court pointed out that the cancellation was<br />
made not on the ground that the activities of the trust<br />
were not genuine but the activities of the trust were not<br />
in accordance with the objects of the trust; when the<br />
trust was registered with definite objects, carrying on<br />
such activities would be in terms of the objects for which<br />
registration was granted.<br />
40. Referring to Section 12AA of the Income Tax Act,<br />
1961, this Court has held as under:-<br />
&#8221; 9. Under section 12AA, the Commissioner is empowered<br />
to grant or refuse the registration and after granting<br />
registration, would be empowered to cancel and that too,<br />
only on two conditions laid down under Section 12AA(3)<br />
of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Whether the income<br />
derived from such transaction would be assessed for tax<br />
and also whether the trust would be entitled to<br />
exemption under section 11 are entirely the matters left<br />
to the assessing officer to decide as to whether it should<br />
be assessed or exempted.&#8221;<br />
41. In the light of the law declared by this Court in the<br />
above said decision, we do not find that the scope of<br />
Section 12AA(3) of the Act is of any doubt for a fresh<br />
look. It is relevant herein to point out that in two other<br />
assessee&#8217;s case, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal,<br />
Ahmedabad Bench-A rendered in the case of Gujarat<br />
Cricket Association Vs. DIT (Exemption) in<br />
ITA.No.93(Ahd)/2011 dated 31.01.2012 and that of the<br />
Nagpur Bench rendered in the case of M/s.Vidarbha<br />
Cricket Association Vs. Commissioner of Income-tax-I,<br />
Nagpur in ITA.No.3/Nag/10 dated 30.05.2011, considered<br />
the said decision reported in 343 ITR 300 in the case of<br />
CIT Vs. Sarvodaya Ilakkiya Pannai rendered under Section<br />
12AA(3) of the Act. On appeal before the respective High<br />
Courts, the decision of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal<br />
was confirmed.<br />
42. Leaving that aside, there being no dispute raised by<br />
the Revenue as to the genuineness of the trust, or as to<br />
the activities of the trust not being in accordance with<br />
the objects of the trust, the question of cancellation<br />
under Section 12AA of the Act does not arise. We further<br />
hold that at the time of grant of registration on<br />
28.3.2003, the same was made taking into consideration<br />
the objects of the institution fitting in with the definition<br />
Page 30 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
of &#8216;charitable purpose&#8217; defined under Section 2(150 of the<br />
Act and the substitution of the Section itself came only<br />
2008, with effect from 01.04.2009. As rightly pointed out<br />
by the learned senior counsel appearing for the assessee,<br />
the circular clearly brings out the object of the<br />
amendment and the amended provision has no relevance<br />
to the case . The power regarding cancellation, hence<br />
has to be seen with reference to the registration and the<br />
object satisfying the definition on &#8216;charitable purpose&#8217;, as<br />
it stood at the time of registration and not by the<br />
subsequent amendment to Section 2(15) of the Income<br />
Tax Act.<br />
43. Learned Standing counsel appearing for the Revenue<br />
placed heavy reliance on the proviso to Section 12AA(3)<br />
of the Act and submitted that when the assessee has<br />
income received from conduct of the matches, which are<br />
commercial in nature, as had been found by the Income<br />
Tax Appellate Tribunal, the objects of the trust ceased to<br />
be charitable. He submitted that going by the definition<br />
of Section 2(15) of the Act, rightly, the Commissioner<br />
assumed jurisdiction under Section 12AA(3) of the Act to<br />
cancel the registration. He further pointed out that for<br />
the finding to be recorded that the activities of the trust<br />
are not genuine, one must necessarily look into the<br />
objects of the association; if the objects of the<br />
association reveal commercial nature in the conduct of<br />
matches, the association cannot be one for charitable<br />
purpose as defined under Section 2(15) of the Act. Thus,<br />
there could be no inhibition for the Commissioner to<br />
assume jurisdiction to issue show cause notice calling<br />
upon the assessee to state whether the association is<br />
genuine or not. He further submitted that on looking at<br />
the activities of the association, the Commissioner had<br />
rightly come to the conclusion that the assessee&#8217;s<br />
registration was liable to be withdrawn.<br />
44. We do not accept the submission of learned Standing<br />
counsel appearing for the Revenue. As rightly observed<br />
by learned Senior counsel appearing for the assessee,<br />
the Revenue granted registration under Section 12AA of<br />
the Act satisfying itself as to the objects of the<br />
association befitting the status as charitable purpose as<br />
defined under Section 2(15), as it stood in 2003 and after<br />
granting the registration, if the registration is to be<br />
cancelled, it must be only on the grounds stated under<br />
Section 12AA(3) of the Act with reference to the objects<br />
Page 31 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
accepted and registered under Section 12AA, as per the<br />
law then stood under the definition of Section 2(15) of<br />
the Income Tax Act. Even therein, Courts have defined as<br />
to when an institution could be held as one for<br />
advancement of any other object of general public utility.<br />
Thus, if a particular activity of the institution appeared to<br />
be commercial in character, and it is not dominant, then<br />
it is for the Assessing Officer to consider the effect of<br />
Section 11 of the Act in the matter of granting exemption<br />
on particular head of receipt. The mere fact that the said<br />
income does not fit in with Section 11 of the Act would<br />
not, by itself, herein lead to the conclusion that the<br />
registration granted under Section 12AA is bad and<br />
hence, to be cancelled.<br />
45. It may be of relevance to note the language used in<br />
the definition &#8220;charitable purpose&#8221; in Section 2(15) of the<br />
Act, which states that charitable purpose includes relief<br />
of the poor, education, medical relief and advancement<br />
of any other object of general public utility. The<br />
assessee&#8217;s case falls within the phrase of the definition<br />
general public utility . In the decision reported in (2000)<br />
246 ITR 188 in the case of Hiralal Bhagwati Vs.<br />
Commissioner of Income Tax, the Gujarat High court<br />
considered the said phrase in the context of Section<br />
12AA registration and held that registration of the<br />
charitable trust under Section 12AA of the Act is not an<br />
idle or empty formality; the Commissioner of Income-tax<br />
has to examine the objects of the trust as well as an<br />
empirical study of the past activities of the applicant; the<br />
Commissioner of Income-tax has to examine that it is<br />
really a charitable trust or institution eligible for<br />
registration; the object beneficial to a section of the<br />
public is an object of &#8220;general public utility&#8221;. The Gujarat<br />
High Court held that to serve as a charitable purpose, it is<br />
not necessary that the object must be to serve the whole<br />
of mankind or all persons living in a country or province;<br />
it is required to be noted that if a section of the public<br />
alone are given the benefit, it cannot be said that it is not<br />
a trust for charitable purpose in the interest of the public;<br />
it is not necessary that the public at large must get the<br />
benefit; the criteria here is the objects of general public<br />
utility. Thus, the Gujarat High Court held that in order to<br />
be charitable, the purpose must be directed to the<br />
benefit of the community or a section of the community;<br />
the expression &#8220;object of general public utility&#8221;, however,<br />
Page 32 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
is not restricted to the objects beneficial to the whole of<br />
mankind; an object beneficial to a section of the public is<br />
an object of general public utility; the section of the<br />
community sought to be benefited must undoubtedly be<br />
sufficiently defined and identifiable by some common<br />
quality of a public or impersonal nature.<br />
46. The above said decision (2000) 246 ITR 188 &#8211; Hiralal<br />
Bhagwati Vs. Commissioner of Income Tax) came up on<br />
April 18, 2000. Evidently, the Revenue has not gone on<br />
appeal as against this judgment. In the decision reported<br />
in (2008) 300 ITR 214(SC) in the case of Assistant<br />
Commissioner of Income Tax Vs. Surat City Gymkhana,<br />
reference was made about this decision and the Apex<br />
Court pointed out that the Revenue did not challenge this<br />
case and it attained finality.<br />
47. It is no doubt true that the decision reported in<br />
(2008) 300 ITR 214(SC) in the case of Assistant<br />
Commissioner of Income Tax Vs. Surat City Gymkhana,<br />
was in the context of Section 10(23) of the Income Tax<br />
Act, 1961, nevertheless, the fact remains that the<br />
understanding of the scope of the expression &#8220;general<br />
public utility&#8221; would nevertheless is of relevance herein.<br />
Admittedly when the assessee was granted registration,<br />
the Revenue recorded its satisfaction that the objects are<br />
of charitable purpose. Thus only possible enquiry under<br />
Section 12AA of the Act for cancellation is to find out<br />
whether the activities of the trust are genuine or in<br />
accordance with the objects of the trust. If any of the<br />
income arising on the activities are not in accordance<br />
with the objects of the trust, the assessees income, at<br />
best, may not get the exemption under Section 11 of the<br />
Act. But this, by itself, does not result in straight rejection<br />
of the registration as &#8216;trust&#8217; under Section 12AA of the<br />
Act. Consequently, we reject the prayer of the Revenue<br />
that Section 12AA(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 must<br />
be read along with Section 12AA(3) of the Income Tax<br />
Act, 1961 before considering the cancellation.<br />
48. As far as the unreported decision of this Court in<br />
T.C(A).No.91 of 2013 dated 29.04.2013 (Gowri Ashram<br />
Vs. Director of Income Tax (Exemptions) is concerned, on<br />
which heavy reliance was placed by the Revenue, the<br />
said decision relates to the rejection of the registration at<br />
the threshold of the application filed for registration. So<br />
too the decision of the Apex court reported in 315 ITR<br />
Page 33 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
428 in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax Vs.<br />
National Institute of Aeronautical Engineering Educational<br />
Society, wherein, rejection was made on the threshold of<br />
application for registration made by the assessee. The<br />
decisions relied on is thus distinguishable and has no<br />
relevance to the facts of the present case.<br />
49. As far as unreported decision of this Court in<br />
T.C(A).No.91 of 2013 dated 29.04.2013 (Gowri Ashram<br />
Vs. Director of Income Tax (Exemptions) is concerned,<br />
while rejecting the appeal filed by the assessee on the<br />
rejection of the application for registration, this Court<br />
observed that it was open for the assessee Society to<br />
renew its application as and when it expanded the<br />
objects of the Society and were approved by the<br />
competent Court. The rejection order passed by the<br />
Revenue was on the ground that the objects of the trust<br />
were not charitable in character. This decision also has<br />
no relevance to the case on hand.<br />
50. As already noted in the preceding paragraphs,<br />
considering the provision under Section 12AA(3) of the<br />
Act, the cancellation or registration in a given case could<br />
be done only under the stated circumstances under<br />
Section 12AA(3) of the Act and in the background of the<br />
definition relevant to the particular year of registration.<br />
As rightly pointed out by the assessee, Revenue does not<br />
allege anything against the genuineness of the objects of<br />
the assessee or its activities. It rests its order only on the<br />
ground of the assessee receiving income from holding of<br />
matches which according to the assessee were not held<br />
by it. Thus, as regards the question as to whether the<br />
particular income qualified under Section 11 of the Act or<br />
not is not the same as activity being genuine or not. In<br />
the circumstances, we do not agree with the view of the<br />
Income Tax Appellate Tribunal that the order passed by<br />
the Director of Income Tax (Exemptions) was in<br />
accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act,<br />
1961. He viewed that the conduct of test matches and<br />
ODI are in the nature of commerce or business. Though<br />
the assessee claimed their activities for promotion of<br />
sports, he held that the dominant feature is evident from<br />
the huge profits received and hence the amount received<br />
from BCCI as subsidy are commercial. As regards<br />
conducting of IPL Matches, he pointed out that though no<br />
services are rendered by the assessee for conducting the<br />
matches, the ground where the matches are played are<br />
Page 34 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
given for rent which is a commercial venture. The subsidy<br />
received from BCCI included mainly TV Advertisements<br />
sold by BCCI for the conduct of IPL and their commercial<br />
receipts arising for IPL transactions. Therefore, the nature<br />
of receipt was important than the name of account under<br />
which it was accounted. Thus he viewed that the objects<br />
and activities would no longer come within the definition<br />
of Section 2(15) of the Act after the amendment come in<br />
effect from 01.04.2009.<br />
51. As rightly pointed out by the assessee, the Revenue<br />
does not question the objects of the Association as not<br />
genuine or are in accordance with the objects. All that<br />
the Revenue stated was that the nature of receipt could<br />
not be called a subsidy. Thus Revenue came to the<br />
conclusion that the objects and activities could not come<br />
within the meaning of &#8216;charitable purpose&#8217; under Section<br />
2(15) of the Act.<br />
52. On going through the materials, the Income Tax<br />
Appellate Tribunal pointed out that instead of promoting<br />
and developing the game of cricket, the assessee was<br />
promoting and developing cricket as an entertainment<br />
and the tickets are highly priced; here, the assessee has<br />
shifted the activities of general public utility to<br />
commercial activity for generating revenue; the public<br />
merely participate to view costly matches; hence the<br />
conditions of Section 12AA(3) were satisfied. The Income<br />
Tax Appellate Tribunal agreed with the Director of<br />
Income Tax (Exemptions) that the expression &#8216;subsidy<br />
from BCCI&#8217; was a misleading nomenclature and it was a<br />
share from the revenue collected by BCCI from the sale<br />
of telecast rights. The surplus from IPL Season-I worked<br />
out to 8.5% of the total receipts. It further held that 78%<br />
of the total receipt came out of advertisement revenue.<br />
53. The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal pointed out that<br />
the physical aspect of the game was one in accordance<br />
with the objects of the assessee and the activities are<br />
genuine. However, the matches held were not in<br />
advancement of any specific object of general public<br />
utility. The pattern of receipt is commercial in character<br />
and the matches conducted are not in accordance with<br />
the objects of the Association. Thus, it rejected the<br />
assessee&#8217;s case and held that both the conditions under<br />
Section 12AA(3) of the Act stood attracted.<br />
54. As seen from the observation of the Income Tax<br />
Page 35 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
Appellate Tribunal, although generally it accepted the<br />
case of the assessee that the physical aspect of the<br />
game was one in accordance with the objects, the<br />
quantum of receipt apparently led the Income Tax<br />
Appellate Tribunal and the Revenue to come to the<br />
conclusion that the activities are commercial and hence<br />
by Section 2(15) proviso to the Act, the receipt from BCCI<br />
could not be called as subsidy. As for the observation of<br />
the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal that the twin<br />
conditions stood satisfied is concerned, it is not denied by<br />
the Revenue that at the time of granting registration, the<br />
Commissioner had satisfied himself about the objects of<br />
the trust and the genuineness of the activities as falling<br />
within the meaning of &#8216;charitable purpose&#8217;, as it stood in<br />
2003. The Revenue does not deny as a matter of fact<br />
that the objects remain as it was in 2003 and there is no<br />
change in its content to call the assessee&#8217;s object as not<br />
genuine. There are no materials to indicate that the grant<br />
of registration was not based on materials indicating<br />
objects of general public utility.<br />
55.The assessee is a member of Board of Control for<br />
Cricket in India (BCCI), which in turn is a member of<br />
ICC(International Cricket Council). BCCI allots test<br />
matches with visiting foreign team and one day<br />
international matches to various member cricket<br />
association which organise the matches in their stadia.<br />
The franchisees conduct matches in the Stadia belonging<br />
to the State Cricket Association. The State Association is<br />
entitled to all in-stadia sponsorship advertisement and<br />
beverage revenue and it incurs expenses for the conduct<br />
of the matches. BCCI earns revenue by way of<br />
sponsorship and media rights as well as franchisee<br />
revenue for IPL and it distributes 70% of the revenue to<br />
the member cricket association. Thus the assessee is<br />
also the recipient of the revenue. Thus, for invoking<br />
Section 12AA read with Section 2(15) of the Act, Revenue<br />
has to show that the activities are not fitting with the<br />
objects of the Association and that the dominant<br />
activities are in the nature of trade, commerce and<br />
business. We do not think that by the volume of receipt<br />
one can draw the inference that the activity is<br />
commercial. The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal&#8217;s view<br />
that it is an entertainment and hence offended Section<br />
2(15) of the Act does not appear to be correct and the<br />
same is based on its own impression on free ticket,<br />
Page 36 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
payment of entertainment tax and presence of cheer<br />
group and given the irrelevant consideration. These<br />
considerations are not germane in considering the<br />
question as to whether the activities are genuine or<br />
carried on in accordance with the objects of the<br />
Association. We can only say that the Income Tax<br />
Appellate Tribunal rested its decision on consideration<br />
which are not relevant for considering the test specified<br />
under Section 12AA(3) to impose commercial character<br />
to the activity of the Association. In the circumstances,<br />
we agree with the assessee that the Revenue has not<br />
made out any ground to cancel the registration under<br />
Section 12AA(3) of the Act.<br />
56. As regards the observation of the Income Tax<br />
Appellate Tribunal that IPL Matches and Celebrity Cricket<br />
Matches are also being held by the Association and<br />
hence it is an entertainment industry, we need not go<br />
into these aspects, for, the order of the Director of<br />
Income Tax (Exemptions) casts no doubt on the<br />
genuineness of the objects of the trust. Hence, it is for<br />
the Assessing Officer to take note of all facts, while<br />
considering the same under Section 11 of the Income Tax<br />
Act, 1961. We disapprove the approach of the Tribunal in<br />
this regard. In the above said circumstances, we set<br />
aside the order of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. “<br />
33. The Delhi High Court, in the case of M/s. GST India vs.<br />
DIT, Delhi, reported in 360 ITR 138, held that:<br />
&#8220;Section 2(15) of the Income-tax Act, 1961, was<br />
amended by the Finance Act, 2008, with effect from April<br />
1, 2009, and a proviso was added to it. A second proviso<br />
was inserted to section 2(15) by the Finance Act, 2010,<br />
with retrospective effect from April 1, 2009. There are<br />
four main factors that need to be taken into<br />
consideration before classifying the activity of the<br />
assesseee as &#8220;charitable&#8221; under the residuary category,<br />
i.e.,&#8221; advancement of any other object of general public<br />
utility&#8221; under section 2(15) of the Act. The four factors<br />
are (i) the activity should be for advancement of general<br />
public utility; (ii) the activity should not involve any<br />
activity in the nature of trade, commerce and business;<br />
(iii) the activity should not involve rendering any service<br />
in relation to any trade, commerce, or business; and (iv)<br />
Page 37 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
the activities in clauses (ii) and (iii) should not be for fee,<br />
cess or other consideration and if for fee, cess or<br />
consideration the aggregate value of the receipts from<br />
the activities under (ii) and (iii) should not exceed the<br />
amount specified in the second proviso. The earlier test<br />
of business feeding or application of income earned<br />
towards charity because of the statutory amendment is<br />
no longer relevant and apposite. It is evident from<br />
Circular No. 11 of2008 that a new proviso to section<br />
2(15) of the Act is applicable to assessees who are<br />
engaged in commercial activities, i.e., carrying on<br />
business, trade or commerce, in the garb of &#8220;public<br />
utility&#8221; to avoid tax liability. The legal terms &#8220;trade,<br />
commerce, or business&#8221; in section 2(15) mean activity<br />
undertaken with a view to make or earn profit. Profit<br />
motive is determinative and a critical factor to discern<br />
whether an activity is business, trade or commerce.<br />
Business activity has an important pervading element of<br />
self-interest, though fair dealing should and can be<br />
present, whilst charity or charitable activity is the antithesis<br />
of activity undertaken with profit motive or activity<br />
undertaken on sound or recognised business principles.<br />
The quantum of fee charged, the economic status of the<br />
beneficiaries who pay commercial value of benefits, in<br />
comparison to the fee, the purpose and object behind the<br />
fee, etc., are several factors which will decide the<br />
seminal question, is it business? Charitable activities<br />
require operational/running expenses as well as capital<br />
expenses to be able to sustain and continue in the long<br />
run. There is no statutory mandate that a charitable<br />
institution falling under the last clause should be wholly,<br />
substantially or in part must be funded by voluntary<br />
contributions. A practical and pragmatic view is required<br />
to examine the data, which should be analysed<br />
objectively and a narrow and coloured view will be<br />
counter-productive and contrary to the language of<br />
section 2(15). The second proviso applies when business<br />
was/is conducted and the quantum of receipts exceeds<br />
the specified sum. The proviso does not seek to<br />
disqualify a charitable organization covered by the last<br />
limb, when a token fee is collected from the beneficiaries<br />
in the course of activity which is not a business but<br />
clearly charity for which it is established and it<br />
undertakes.”<br />
Page 38 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
34. The principles of law discernible from the aforesaid two<br />
decisions may be summed up thus:-<br />
(a) For the purpose of cancellation of the registration u/s<br />
12AA(3), the Commissioner should record a satisfaction that<br />
the activities of the Trust or Institution are not genuine or that<br />
the activities are not being carried on in accordance with the<br />
objects of the Trust. In the absence of such a finding, the<br />
registration granted u/s 12A or u/s 12AA cannot be cancelled.<br />
Cancellation of registration of a charitable Trust, in a given<br />
case, is permissible, only under the circumstances stated u/s<br />
12AA(3) of the Act.<br />
(b) For an assessee to be classified as charitable under the<br />
residuary category i.e. &#8220;advancement of any other object of<br />
general public utility&#8221; u/s 2(15) of the Act, the following four<br />
factors need to be satisfied.<br />
i) Activity should be for the advancement of the &#8216;general<br />
public utility&#8217;.<br />
ii) Activity should not be in the nature of trade, commerce<br />
or business.<br />
iii) Activity should not involve rendering of services in<br />
relation to any trade, commerce or business.<br />
iv) Activities in Clauses b and c above, should not be for<br />
fees, cess or other consideration, the aggregate value of which<br />
should not exceed the amount specified in the Second Proviso<br />
to S.2(15).<br />
(c) The earlier test that if the income so collected, is applied<br />
towards the charitable activity, then the trust cannot be held<br />
as non-charitable, is no longer relevant after the statutory<br />
Page 39 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
amendment.<br />
(d) The scope of the term &#8220;activity in the nature of trade,<br />
commerce or business&#8221; would mean that:<br />
i) It is undertaken with a profit motive;<br />
ii) The activity is continued on sound and recognized<br />
business principles and is pursued with reasonable continuity;<br />
iii) There should be facts and other circumstances which<br />
justify and indicate that the activity undertaken is in fact, in<br />
the nature of business;<br />
iv). The five tests propounded in the case of Customs and<br />
Excise Commissioner vs. Lord Fisher (1981) STC 238 and the<br />
propositions in the case of CST vs. Sai Publication Fund 258 ITR<br />
70 (SC) apply.<br />
v). Business activity is an important prevailing element of self<br />
interest.<br />
(e) From a perusal of the Circular no.11 of 2008 issued by the<br />
CBDT, it is clear that the new Proviso of S.2(15) of the Act, is<br />
applicable to the assesses who are engaged in commercial<br />
activities i.e. carrying of trade, commerce or business in the<br />
garb of &#8220;public utility&#8221; to avoid tax liability, and where the<br />
object of the &#8220;general public utility&#8221; is only a mask or device to<br />
hide the true purpose, which was &#8220;trade, commerce or<br />
business.&#8221;<br />
(f) Charitable activity is the anti-thesis of activity having an<br />
element of self interest. Charity is driven by altruism and<br />
desire to serve others, though the element of self preservation<br />
may be present. For charity, benevolence should be<br />
omnipresent and demonstratable but it is not equivalent to self<br />
sacrifice and abnegation.<br />
Page 40 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
(g) The antiquated definition of the term charity, which entails<br />
giving and receiving nothing in return is outdated.<br />
(h) Enrichment of oneself or self-gain should be missing and<br />
the predominant purpose of the activity should be to serve and<br />
benefit others, the mandatory features being, selflessness or<br />
illiberal spirit.<br />
(i) The quantum of fee charged, the economic status of the<br />
beneficiaries who pay, commercial values in comparison to the<br />
fee, purpose and object behind the fee etc. are several factors<br />
which decide the seminal question, is it business?<br />
(j) The Revenue cannot take a contradictory stand that, the<br />
assessee carries on charitable activity under the residuary<br />
head &#8220;general public utility&#8221;, but, simultaneously record the<br />
said activity as business.<br />
(k) There is no statutory mandate that a charitable Institution<br />
falling under the residuary Clauses, should be wholly,<br />
substantially or in part be funded by voluntary contributions.<br />
(l) A pragmatic view is required to be taken while examining<br />
the data and the same should be analysed objectively. A<br />
narrow and coloured view may prove to be counter productive<br />
and contrary to S.2(15) of the Act.<br />
(m) Accumulation of money/funds over a period of two to three<br />
years may not be relevant in determining the nature and<br />
character of the activity and whether the same should be<br />
treated indicative of profit motive i.e. the desire or intention to<br />
carry on business or commerce.<br />
(n) The so called business activities, when intrinsically woven<br />
into and is part of the charitable activity undertaken, the<br />
business activity is not feeding charitable activities, as they<br />
Page 41 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
are integral to the charity/charitable activity.<br />
(o) What has to be seen is, as to what is the core/main activity<br />
of the assessee. The predominant activity shall be the basis of<br />
the decision making.<br />
ANALYSIS<br />
35. It appears from the line of reasoning adopted by the<br />
Assessing Officer and the CIT(A) that both are absolutely<br />
mesmerized or rather hypnotized by the word “BCCI” The<br />
corpus with the BCCI may be huge and the BCCI may be<br />
indulging in commercial transactions like TV rights, IPL<br />
matches etc. However, we fail to understand what has the<br />
BCCI to do directly with the assessee. The assessee is a<br />
registered charitable trust. It has its own objects. It has its<br />
own activities for the purpose of promoting the game of<br />
cricket, or in other words, imparting education in the game of<br />
cricket. The BCCI may ask the Association to host a cricket<br />
match at the international level once in a year or two.<br />
However, that by itself, is not sufficient to draw an inference<br />
that the assessee-Association is indulging in commercial<br />
activity with an element of profit motive.<br />
36. We are quite amazed with some of the findings recorded<br />
by the Assessing Officer as well as the CIT(A). One of the<br />
findings recorded is that the Association should not sell tickets<br />
for watching the cricket matches. Are the authorities trying to<br />
convey that the Association should not sell tickets even when it<br />
comes to international matches. How does the Revenue expect<br />
the Association to distribute the tickets in such circumstances.<br />
Page 42 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
37. Having regard to the materials on record, we are<br />
convinced that the main and predominant object and activity<br />
of the assessee is to promote, regulate and control the game<br />
of cricket in the State of Gujarat. The undisputed fact is that<br />
over a period of years, this activity has been recognized by the<br />
Income Tax Department as a charitable activity and the<br />
registration under Section 12A of the Act was granted to the<br />
assessee. A number of assessment orders under Section<br />
143(3) were passed, wherein the assessee was held eligible for<br />
the exemption under Sections 11 and 12 of the Act. It appears<br />
that it is only after the Proviso came to be inserted that, all of a<br />
sudden, the department now believes that the activity of the<br />
assessee is commercial in nature and no longer charitable. It<br />
is difficult for us to take the view that the assessee could be<br />
said to be carrying on “trade, commerce or business” under<br />
the garb of the activity being “general public utility”. Merely<br />
because an activity is performed in an organized manner, that<br />
alone, will not make such activities as business/commercial<br />
activity. The profit motive is one essential ingredient which is<br />
apparently missing in the case on hand. In carrying out an<br />
activity, one may earn profit or one may incur loss. But for<br />
making it as a business activity, the presence of the profit<br />
motive is sine qua non.<br />
38. In the case on hand, the ultimate beneficiary is either the<br />
cricketer or the game of cricket. The assessee is not charging<br />
any fees or revenue from the cricketer who is the ultimate<br />
beneficiary. Thus there is no quid pro quo relationship with the<br />
cricketer. The assessee is promoting cricket on the charitable<br />
basis as far as real beneficiary is concerned. Whenever the<br />
Page 43 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
revenue is earned, the same is not on commercial lines and<br />
the same could be said to be earned without any commercial<br />
attributes. The revenue is generated for recovering the cost, at<br />
least partly if not in full.<br />
39. Mr. Shah also invited our attention to the observations<br />
made by this High Court in the case of Commissioner of<br />
Income Tax vs. Sarabhai Sons Ltd., (1983) 143 ITR 473<br />
(Guj.). Mr. Shah seeks to rely upon this decision, more<br />
particularly, the observations we shall quote hereinafter to<br />
make good his submission that the view taken by the Madras<br />
High Court should be accepted in conformity with the uniform<br />
policy as laid down in the Income Tax matters. We quote the<br />
observations upon which Mr. Shah would like to rely upon;<br />
“Under the circumstances, as observed by Chagla, CJ, in<br />
Maneklal Chunilal &#038; Sons Ltd. vs. CIT (1953) 24 ITR 375<br />
(Bom.) in conformity with the uniform policy, which has<br />
been laid down in income tax matters, whatever our<br />
view may be, we must accept the view taken by the<br />
another High Court on the interpretation of the section of<br />
a statute which is in all India statute. Similar view has<br />
expressed by the Bombay High Court in Ramanlal<br />
Amarnath (Agency) Ltd. vs. CIT (1973) 91 ITR 250, while<br />
following a decision of this Court in Baroda Traders Ltd.<br />
vs. CIT (1965) 57 ITR 490. Even though, we may be<br />
persuaded to take a different view, we are not inclined to<br />
do so in view of the settled practice referred to in the<br />
decision of the Madras High Court and the decision of<br />
Bombay High Court and the Madhya Pradesh High Court<br />
adverted to above. Therefore, respectfully following the<br />
decisions of the Madras High Court and the Madhya<br />
Pradesh High Court, we must answer the third question<br />
referred to us also in the affirmative and against the<br />
revenue.”<br />
40. However, Mr. Bhatt would submit, by placing reliance on<br />
the decision of this Court in the case of N.R. Paper &#038; Board<br />
Page 44 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
Limited vs. Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax, 1998<br />
(234) ITR 733 that while the decision of any other High Court is<br />
entitled to highest esteem and respect by this Court, the<br />
system of law should not be evolved by such mechanical<br />
process of following the dictum as laid. According to Mr. Bhatt,<br />
if it becomes impossible to agree with the decisions of the<br />
other High Courts, this Court should be free to give its reasons<br />
which may not coincide with the conclusions reached in the<br />
persuasive precedent relied upon. Mr. Bhatt seeks to rely upon<br />
the following observations of this Court, as contained in para-<br />
27;<br />
“27. While the decision of any other High Court is entitled<br />
to our highest esteem and respect, the constitutional<br />
powers of the High Court in its writ jurisdiction cannot be<br />
reduced to simply matching the colours of the case at<br />
hand against the colours of many sample cases spread<br />
out upon its desk and accept the sample nearest in<br />
shade as the applicable rule. The system of law cannot<br />
be evolved by such mechanical process and no judge of a<br />
High Court worthy of his office, views the function of his<br />
place so narrowly. If that were all there was to our calling<br />
there will be little of intellectual interest about it.<br />
The choice of a path for us cannot be made so blind and<br />
unintelligent, to be followed without a survey of the route<br />
which has been travelled and of the place where it would<br />
lead. Necessarily therefore, reasons that are given in the<br />
decisions of other High Courts relied upon for the<br />
petitioners, which have great persuasive value as<br />
precedent are required to be considered and the<br />
consequences are to be noted and if it becomes<br />
impossible to agree with them, or if there are no reasons<br />
at all and only announcements of legal precepts, the<br />
court would be free to give its reasons, which may not<br />
coincide with the conclusions reached in the persuasive<br />
precedent relied upon. The decisions of any High Court<br />
are after all not intended to be &#8220;gag orders&#8221; for other<br />
High Courts and do not have the effect of freezing judicial<br />
thinking on the points covered by them. This is why in<br />
Page 45 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
Arvind Boards and Paper Products Ltd. [1982] 137 ITR<br />
635 (Guj), the court after reviewing the authorities on the<br />
subject, clearly spelt out exceptions, such as where the<br />
decision is sub-silentio, per incuriam, obiter dicta or<br />
based on a concession or takes a view which it is<br />
impossible to arrive at, etc., which would justify the High<br />
Court from taking its own view and not just follow the<br />
precedent which may otherwise have a persuasive value,<br />
though not binding.”<br />
41. Mr. Bhatt, the learned senior counsel appearing for the<br />
Revenue may be right in his submission that if this Court is not<br />
persuaded to follow the view taken by the High Court of<br />
Madras in the case of Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (supra),<br />
then by only following the principle as laid down in the case of<br />
Maneklal (supra), this Court may not adopt or follow the view<br />
of the High Court of Madras for the purpose of consistency.<br />
We may only say that having regard to the materials on<br />
record, we are not persuaded to take a different view than the<br />
one taken by the High Court of Madras. Therefore, we are not<br />
going much into the issue as regards the dictum as laid down<br />
in Maneklal (supra). We find the view taken by the ITAT in its<br />
impugned order quite reasonable and in accordance with law.<br />
The Tribunal, in its impugned order, has made itself very clear<br />
that it was not expressing any opinion on the merits of the<br />
issue as to whether the activities of the GCA would fall within<br />
the meaning of charitable purpose in accordance with Section<br />
2(15) of the Act as amended. The ITAT has also clarified that<br />
the issue with regard to registration under Section 12AA of the<br />
Act can be examined in the assessment proceedings.<br />
42. In the aforesaid view of the matter, we are not convinced<br />
with the case put up by the Revenue. It is not the case of the<br />
Page 46 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
Revenue that the objects of the Trust are not charitable, but<br />
the case of the Revenue is that the activities undertaken by<br />
the Association are not charitable in nature.<br />
43. In the result, this appeal fails and is hereby dismissed.<br />
The substantial question of law, as formulated by this Court, is<br />
answered in favour of the assessee and against the Revenue.<br />
Tax Appeal No.317 of 2019<br />
44. We shall now take up the Tax Appeal No.317 of 2019.<br />
This tax appeal under Section 260A of the Income Tax Act,<br />
1961 is at the instance of the Revenue and is directed against<br />
the order passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal,<br />
Ahmedabad, Bench &#8216;D&#8217;, Ahmedabad in the ITA<br />
No.1257/Ahd/2013 for the A.Y.2009-10. This tax appeal came<br />
to be admitted by this Court vide order dated 15th July, 2019 on<br />
the following substantial questions of law;<br />
“[A]. Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of<br />
the case the Appellate Tribunal was justified in allowing<br />
the benefit of Sections 11 and 12 when the Assessing<br />
Officer has clearly brought on record that assessee is<br />
covered under the proviso to Section 2(15) r.w.s 13(8) of<br />
the Act?<br />
[B]. Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of<br />
the case the Appellate Tribunal has erred in holding that<br />
the assessee is not covered under the proviso to section<br />
2(15) when the Officer has clearly brought on record that<br />
assessee is engaged in the activity of “advancement of<br />
objects of general public utility?”<br />
[C]. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case<br />
and in law, the Appellate Tribunal was justified in deleting<br />
the addition made in respect of corpus donations<br />
u/s.11(l)(d) of the Act without appreciating that the<br />
assessee failed to discharge its onus by not bringing<br />
anything on record in support of its claim of corpus<br />
donation?”<br />
Page 47 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
[D]. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case<br />
and in law, the Appellate Tribunal was justified in deleting<br />
the addition made on account of infrastructure subsidy of<br />
Rs.2,13,34,033/-, treating it as capital receipts without<br />
appreciating the findings of the Assessing Officer?”<br />
45. We may borrow the facts giving rise to this appeal from<br />
the memorandum of the appeal. The pleadings in the memo of<br />
the appeal are as under;<br />
“(A) In the present case, the assessee filed its return of<br />
income on 14/09/2009 declaring total loss of<br />
Rs.3,45,54,247/-. The summary assessment u/s.143(1) of<br />
the Act was resulted in Refund of Rs.46,14,500/-. The<br />
assessment u/s.143(3) of the Act was completed on<br />
30/12/2011 determining total income at<br />
Rs.22,77,02,663/-.<br />
(B) Disallowance of benefit of section 11 of the Act.<br />
1) During the assessment proceedings, the Assessing<br />
Officer observed that the activity of the assessee was<br />
held as in the nature of trade, business or commerce for<br />
a cess or fees in the form of tickets with profit motive<br />
and the receipt from the BCCI in the form of TV rights<br />
was not voluntary contribution but price paid for hosting<br />
cricket tournament on assessee’s stadium and therefore,<br />
it was not educational activity of the assessee. The<br />
activity of the assessee was running of its business of<br />
entertainment of the people at large for a fee of cess by<br />
arranging cricket tournament at various levels. Further,<br />
the DlT(E), Ahmedabad had passed speaking order<br />
considering all the relevant legal and actual position<br />
cancelling the registration u/s.12AA(3) of the Act on<br />
06/12/2010 w.e.f. A.Y. 2004-05 onwards. The Assessing<br />
Officer relied upon the decision of Hon. Supreme Court in<br />
the case of Sole Trustee Loka Shikshana Trust Vs CIT<br />
(1975) 101 ITR 234 (SC). The Assessing Officer held that<br />
the BCCI is the richest Sport Authority in India. Arranging<br />
national and international level cricket tournament and<br />
its allocation to various affiliated Associations like the<br />
assessee and preparation for conduct of such cricket<br />
matches, selection of players, coaches, venue, TV<br />
Broadcasting rights, Audio &#038; Video Publicity, sale of<br />
tickets, issue of license for parking lots, sale of edibles<br />
Page 48 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
and drinking water in stadium during tournament, five<br />
star arrangement of lodging and boarding for players,<br />
arrangement of security for players and in stadium a lot<br />
of other ancillary squarely fit in the definition of trade or<br />
services for profit as defined by the Apex Courts.<br />
Therefore, the Assessing Officer held that the activities<br />
carried out by the assessee were in the nature of<br />
advancement of any other object of general public utility.<br />
Accordingly, the Assessing Officer had invoked provisions<br />
of section 2(15) of the Act and thereby denying benefit of<br />
section 11(1)(a) or 11(1)(b) of the Act.<br />
2) Being aggrieved, the assessee filed appeal before<br />
CIT(A). The CIT(A) had held that the assessee was not<br />
doing any charitable/educational activity by promoting<br />
game of cricket but it was in the business of<br />
entertainment of people at large by arranging/hosting<br />
national and international levels cricket tournaments and<br />
thereby received approximately 3 crores which indicate<br />
that the activities of the assessee was carrying out<br />
activities in the nature of trade, commerce or business.<br />
The C1T(A) relied on the decision of Hon. Supreme Court<br />
in the case of Sole Trustee Loka Shikshana Trust Vs CIT<br />
101 ITR 234 (SC) and Hon. High Court of Calcutta in the<br />
case of Cricket Association of Bengal Vs CIT 37 ITR 277<br />
(Calcutta). The C1T(A) held that with the introduction of<br />
Section 13(8) of the Act w.e.f. 01/04/2009 (Finance Act,<br />
2012) it was clear that the assessee was covered by the<br />
proviso to section 2(15) of the Act. Accordingly, the<br />
C1T(A) had dismissed the appeal of the assessee.<br />
3) Being aggrieved, the assessee preferred appeal<br />
before the Appellate Tribunal. The Appellate Tribunal<br />
relied on co-ordinate bench’s decision in the case of<br />
Hoshiarpur Improvement Trust Vs ACIT (2015) 155 ITD<br />
570 (Asr) which were approved by the Hon. Punjab &#038;<br />
Haryana high Court in the case of C1T(E) Vs<br />
Improvement Trust Monga in TA No. 147 of 2016<br />
reported as Tribune Trust Vs C1T(2017) 390 ITR 547<br />
(P&#038;H). Further, Appellate Tribunal has relied on the<br />
decision of this Hon’ble Court in the case of Sabarmati<br />
Gaushala Trust and held that accrual of profit cannot be<br />
held that the assessee is not covered by the section<br />
2(15) of the Act. The receipts in the hands of the cricket<br />
associations are nothing but appropriation of profits and<br />
that are not taxable. Further, the Department has not<br />
Page 49 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
been able to point out a single object of the assessee<br />
which is in the nature of trade, commerce or business.<br />
On perusal of the annual reports and annual financial<br />
statements of the assessee, the objects of the assessee<br />
exist and operate purely for the purpose of promoting<br />
cricket. The Appellate Tribunal held that the assessee<br />
cricket associations were not really engaged in the<br />
activities in the nature of trade, commerce or business.<br />
Accordingly, the Appellate Tribunal held that the<br />
assessee has covered by the section 2(15) of the Act and<br />
thus the assessee is entitled to relief u/s.11l of the Act.<br />
4) The decision of the Appellate Tribunal is erroneous.<br />
It is seen that control of cricket is in a few powerful hands<br />
and that cricket is completely monopolized by the Board<br />
of Cricket Control in India. The BCCI is not a rank outsider<br />
for these cricket associations but the apex bodies of<br />
these cricket associations. These cricket associations act<br />
in tandem with the BCCI and the cricket is pursued in as<br />
commercial a manner as it can be pursued auction of<br />
players for playing matches and the format of the<br />
matches being improvised as per the requirements of<br />
commercial interests. It is submitted that cricket as it is<br />
pursued by the BCCI and its affiliates is pure<br />
entertainment, and these are the dictates of its<br />
entertainment value that decides the form and<br />
presentation of cricket. If it is a noble activity of<br />
education in a gentleman’s sport, where is the need of<br />
auctioning of the players. The commerce is glaring in<br />
each facet of cricket today. It is also submitted that even<br />
imparting cricket coaching is a big business rather than a<br />
selfless education. What is being pursued by these<br />
associations is pure commercial exploitation of cricket<br />
and that is the reason that the profits of these<br />
associations needs to be brought to tax. The financial<br />
relationship between the assessees and the BCCI cannot<br />
be without quid pro quo between the BCCI and these<br />
cricket associations, or else why would anyone share<br />
such huge amounts with cricket associations. BCCI<br />
organizes the events on pure commercial lines, makes<br />
huge monies on organizing these events, and share the<br />
monies with the local cricket associations. What the<br />
associations get is on account of fruits of the commercial<br />
operations, and that precisely is the reason these monies<br />
should be brought to tax. Learned Commissioner then<br />
takes us through the legislative amendments to Section<br />
Page 50 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
2(15) and links the same to how the sports have been<br />
exploited commercially in the last few decades. It is an<br />
admitted position that the cricket associations were all<br />
along treated as involved in “advancement of an object<br />
of general public utility” and, effective 1st April 2009, the<br />
proviso to Section 2(15) came in force which made it<br />
clear that if the activities of such institutions is in the<br />
nature of trade, commerce or business or rendition of<br />
services, for a cess, fee or any other consideration, to the<br />
business entities. The principle is clear. When you are<br />
here to make money from such activities on commercial<br />
lines, in the garb pursuing advancement of an object of<br />
general public utility, you may as well pay tax on the<br />
earnings from such activities. There is no dispute that the<br />
cricket is now biggest source of making money and,<br />
therefore, the income of the entities organizing cricket<br />
events should also be taxed. It is pertinent to mention<br />
that as per the CBDT Circular No.395 dated 24/09/1984,<br />
it was held that promotion of sports and games is<br />
“advancement of objects of general public utility’. Thus,<br />
in the instant case, the Assessee is clearly engaged in an<br />
activity that is of “advancement of objects of general<br />
public utility”. Since the Assessee is covered by the last<br />
limb of the definition of Section 2(15), now it is to be<br />
seen whether the conditions in the proviso 1 of the<br />
Section 2(15) are applicable to the facts of the case. It is<br />
very clear from the audited accounts of the assessee that<br />
it earns income out of sale of tickets, sale of space, A/C<br />
Cabin Ticket sale etc. out of the cricket matches<br />
conducted at the grounds of cricket association which is<br />
nothing but a business activity carried out by the<br />
Assessee. Thus, it is clearly evident that the Assessee is<br />
engaged in business activity, thereby satisfying the<br />
conditions prescribed in the proviso 1 to Section 2(15) of<br />
the I.T Act. Since the gross receipts of the Assessee<br />
exceed the amount decided in the provisos, the<br />
provisions of the second proviso to Section 2(15) of the<br />
I.T Act are also satisfied. Thus, the Assessee is clearly<br />
covered by the provisions of Section 2(15) read with the<br />
proviso 1 &#038; 2 to the said section.<br />
[C] Disallowance of corpus donation.<br />
(1) During the assessment proceedings, the Assessing<br />
Officer observed that the assessee claimed to have been<br />
received amount of Rs.20,69,60,338/being corpus from<br />
Page 51 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
BCCI and sponsorship money of Rs.20,00,000/ from<br />
Reliance Industries Ltd. The assessee was asked to<br />
submit documentary evidences to support its claim for<br />
corpus donation. The assessee failed to discharge its<br />
onus either by bringing anything on records or producing<br />
representative of BCCI as its witness in support of its<br />
claim of corpus donation that can be considered as<br />
corpus donation on instruction of BCCI. The auditor was<br />
also of the opinion that the amount of Rs.20,69,60,338/<br />
considered as corpus was not in consonance with<br />
provisions of law and facts of the case. The Assessing<br />
Officer held that the assessee had not complied with the<br />
requirements of section 11(1)(d) of the Act. Accordingly,<br />
the claim of corpus donation of Rs.20,69,60,338/- of the<br />
assessee was rejected by the Assessing Officer.<br />
2) Being aggrieved, the assessee filed appeal before the<br />
CIT(A). The CIT(A) held that no written specific direction<br />
was available with the respective amounts for the<br />
respective A.Ys. Accordingly, the CIT(A) held that the<br />
Assessing Officer has rightly treated the donation<br />
received from the BCCI as income of the assessee and<br />
thereby had confirmed the addition of Rs.20.69,60,338/-.<br />
3) Being aggrieved. the assessee preferred appeal before<br />
the Appellate Tribunal. The Appellate Tribunal held that<br />
there was specific confirmation to the effect that<br />
amounts were corpus donations. Further, on perusal of<br />
the BCCI resolution No. 5 which specifically stated that<br />
the TV subsidies should henceforth be sent to the<br />
member association towards corpus funds. Therefore,<br />
any payments made by the BCCI, without a legal<br />
obligation and with a specific direction that shall be form<br />
corpus fund. Thus, the condition u/s.l 11(1)(d) of the Act<br />
are satisfied. The Appellate Tribunal has relied on the<br />
decisions in assessee’s own case in orders for A.Ys. 2004-<br />
05 to 2007-08 and thus directed the Assessing Officer to<br />
treat the TV subsidy of Rs.20,69,60,338/received from<br />
BCCI as a corpus donation.<br />
4) The decision of the Appellate Tribunal is erroneous. As<br />
per provisions of section 11(1)(d) of the Act voluntary<br />
contributions with a specific direction that can be used as<br />
a corpus donation. However, in the instant case there is<br />
no specific direction from the BCCI to treat the said<br />
amounts as towards the ‘corpus fund’. If the intention of<br />
Page 52 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
the donor was to donate this amount towards the ‘corpus<br />
fund’ of the assesee, then it has to be specifically<br />
mentioned. In the absence of written direction, a<br />
particular donation cannot be considered as ‘corpus<br />
donation’. In this case, as the specific direction was<br />
clearly missing, said receipt of subsidy had to be<br />
considered as the income of the assessee trust and it<br />
cannot be exempt u/s.11(1)(d) of the Act.<br />
[D] Disallowance of infrastructure subsidy<br />

Income &#038; Expenditure A/c., the assessee had received<br />
amount of Rs.3,98,07,028/-. The Assessing Officer relied<br />
upon the decision of Hon. Supreme Court in the case of<br />
Sole Trustee Loka Shikshana Trust Vs CIT (1975) 101 ITR<br />
234 (SC). The Assessing Officer held that the BCCI is the<br />
richest Sport Authority in India. Arranging national and<br />

Offlcer had invoked provisions of section 2(15) of the Act<br />

consideration, had received infrastructure subsidy from<br />
BCCI of Rs.3,52,86,521/- and had utilized of<br />
Rs.1,39,52,488/- by way of payment of District Cricket<br />
Association. Therefore, differential amount of<br />
Rs.2,13,34,033lwas added to the total income of the<br />
assessee.<br />
2) Being aggrieved, the assessee preferred appeal<br />
before CIT(A). The CIT(A) held that the assessee was not<br />
an educational institution within the meaning of section<br />
2(15) of the Act. The CIT(A) partly allowed the appeal of<br />
the assessee.<br />
3) Being aggrieved, the assessee preferred appeal before<br />
Appellate Tribunal. The Appellate Tribunal held that the<br />
Assessing Officer has not justified in holding that<br />
infrastructure subsidy as revenue in nature. The assessee<br />
was made claim for subsidy only after the expenditure<br />
having been incurred which is relatable to capital assets.<br />
The infrastructure subsidy was given to the assessee for<br />
the reimbursement of 50% of expenditure which was<br />
incurred on infrastructure related to the capital assets<br />
and therefore it was not revenue receipt. Accordingly,<br />
the Appellate Tribunal has deleted the addition of<br />
Rs.2,13,34,033/-.<br />
4) The decision of the Appellate Tribunal erroneous. In<br />
the cases of trusts, the trust is eligible to claim both<br />
revenue as well as capital expenses as application of<br />
income, so all expenses claimed as application of income<br />
should be first treated as income and be routed through<br />
the profit and loss accounts.<br />
The tax effect involved is Rs.7,72,84,442/- which is above<br />
the prescribed monetary limit under the Board’s Circular<br />
No.03/2018 dated 11/07/2018.”<br />

C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
48. The Assessing Officer took the view that the activities of<br />
the Association cannot be termed as “charitable activities”.<br />
The Assessing Officer took the view that the objects of the<br />
trust may be to promote the game of cricket, but the activities<br />
are covered by the Proviso to the fourth limb of Section 2(15)<br />
of the Act. The Assessing Officer also took the view that the<br />
activities of the Association cannot even be termed as the<br />
educational activities. In short, the Assessing Officer took the<br />
view that the Association is engaged in business. It derives<br />
profit from its so-called charitable activities. In such<br />
circumstances, according to the Assessing Officer, the<br />
Association is not entitled to seek exemption under Section 11<br />
of the Act. The Assessing Officer, in its order, has observed as<br />
under;<br />
“iv) The legal position as contained in the amended<br />
definition of &#8216;Charitable Purpose&#8217; u/s 2(15) of the Act and<br />
explained vide Clause 4.3 of CBDT Circular No. 1 of 2009<br />
dt. 27-05-2009 on I.T. Act 2008, Finance Minister&#8217;s<br />
Speech, the Notes on Clauses, Memorandum Explaining<br />
the provisions of Finance Bill, CBDT circular No. 11 of<br />
2008 dt. 19/12/2008, as well as the alternative<br />
submission of the assessee is considered but not found<br />
acceptable for the reasons stated below.<br />
(a) The assessee has claimed that it is an Educational<br />
Institute. The claim of the assessee is not acceptable in<br />
view &#8216;Education&#8217; defined by H&#8217;ble Apex Court has in the<br />
case of Sole Trustee Loka Shikshana Trust Vs.<br />
Commissioner of Income Tax [1975] 101 ITR 234(SC) has<br />
defined &#8216;Education&#8217; as under:<br />
”Per Khanna J. The sense in which the word &#8216;education<br />
has been used in section 2(15) is the systematic<br />
instruction, schooling or training given to the young is<br />
preparation for the work of life. It also connotes the<br />
whole course of scholastic instruction which a person has<br />
received The word ’education’ has not been used in that<br />
wide and extended sense, according to which every<br />
Page 59 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
acquisition of further knowledge constitutes education.<br />
What education connotes in that clause is the process of<br />
training and developing the knowledge, skill, mind and<br />
character of students by normal schooling.&#8221;<br />
The so called &#8220;Educational Activity&#8221; of the assessee is not<br />
the education activity but an activity directed at to keep<br />
the flow of future cricketers uninterrupted for smooth<br />
running of its business of entertainment of the people at<br />
large for a fee or cess by arranging cricket tournament at<br />
various levels by it as well as hosting them arranged by<br />
BCCI, irrespective of the use of money. It is pertinent to<br />
note that the assessee is imparting only cricket related<br />
training. Hence the claim of the assesse that it is an<br />
&#8216;Educational Institution&#8217; is not acceptable and hence<br />
rejected.<br />
(b) the receipt of the previous year of the assessee as<br />
reported in the Income &#038; Expenditure Account is<br />
Rs.3,98,07,028/- which is not less than Rs. 10 lakh,<br />
(c) The assessee is in the business of entertainment of<br />
public at large by arranging/hosting/managing/executing<br />
cricket matches at national and international level for a<br />
cess or fee or any other consideration, irrespective of the<br />
nature of use or application, or retention, of the income<br />
from such activity. This issue is discussed below at<br />
length.<br />
(d) The analysis of its activities and justification of<br />
applicability of amended definition of &#8220;Charitable<br />
Purpose&#8217; i.e. Carrying on activity, engaged in carrying on<br />
Trade, Commerce or Business etc. and the activities<br />
should be carried out for any fee, cess etc. as analyzed in<br />
the tabular form is misleading and contrary to the<br />
interpretation of any activity, document, agreement or<br />
law as settled by various judicial pronouncements. The<br />
activities and object of the trust should be seen as a<br />
whole. The above referred activities are ancillary to the<br />
main activities of the business of entertainment of people<br />
at large for a fee or cess by arranging/hosting cricket<br />
tournaments on commercial basis with profit motive. The<br />
assessee during year under assessment has earned fee<br />
income of Rs.1,51,97,741/- for India Vs. South Africa Test<br />
Match in Income &#038; Expenditure Account and hence,<br />
assessee&#8217;s claim of non collecting of fees is incorrect.<br />
Page 60 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
(e) As discussed above, the assessee was given ample<br />
opportunities right from the issue and service of first<br />
notice issued u/s 143(2) of the Act dated 24/09/2010,<br />
which provides an opportunities to the assessee to<br />
submit any account, document, statement or evidences<br />
relying upon which it has made its return of income till<br />
last opportunity offered to it vide letter dated 8/12/2011.<br />
The assessee has avoided defining its relation with BCCI,<br />
revenue sharing with BCCI in respect of TV broadcasting<br />
rights of cricket matches played on its ground, nature of<br />
agreements made with RIL for sponsorship, nature of<br />
receipt of income from sale of tickets. The assessee has<br />
failed to discharge its onus to establish the nature of the<br />
income earned in the form of &#8216;Sponsorship Money&#8217;<br />
‘Sharing of TV Broadcasting Income with BCCI. It has<br />
tried &#8216;to conceal the revenue income in the garb of<br />
‘Corpus Donation&#8217;. It has failed to establish why and how<br />
BCCI is giving “Corpus Donation” It is to bring on record<br />
that as against the receipt of &#8216;Sponsorship Money&#8217; of RS.<br />
20,00,000/- from Reliance Industries Ltd., the assessee<br />
has claimed expenses of Rs: 25,84,636/- for Reliance<br />
Inter District Tournaments. Shri Parimal Nathwani holding<br />
a very senior position in Reliance Industries Ltd. is also<br />
Vice<br />
President of the assessee.<br />
It is very well known fact that BCCI is the richest &#8216;Sport<br />
Authority‘ in India. Arranging national and international<br />
level cricket tournament and its allocation to various<br />
affiliated Associations like the assessee, and preparation<br />
for conduct of such cricket matches, selection of Players,<br />
Coaches, venue, TV Broadcasting rights, Audio &#038; Video<br />
Publicity, sale of tickets, issue of license for parking lots,<br />
sale of edibles and drinking water in stadium during<br />
tournament, five star arrangement of lodging and<br />
boarding for players, arrangement of security for players<br />
and in stadium a lot of other ancillary activities squarely<br />
flt in the definition of trade or service for profit as defined<br />
by the Apex court. Even by stretch of imagination it<br />
cannot be considered that the BCCI had its affiliated<br />
bodies who are represented on its board through elected<br />
representative is doing any sort of chaele or educational<br />
activity. The expenses claimed by the assessee in the<br />
Income &#038; Expenditure Account for arranging various<br />
Page 61 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
cricket tournaments in various levels round the year<br />
proves that it is a business activity as defined by Ho&#8217;ble<br />
Apex Court by the above referred judgement. “<br />
49. The assessee, being dissatisfied with the order passed by<br />
the Assessing Officer preferred an appeal before the<br />
Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals). The Commissioner of<br />
Income Tax partly allowed the appeal. However, the<br />
Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) also took the view that<br />
the activities of the Association are not charitable in nature<br />
and the Association is not entitled to claim any exemption<br />
under Sections 11 and 12 of the Act. The CIT (A), while partly<br />
allowing the appeal, held as under;<br />
“26. It is clear from the above that to claim exemption<br />
u/s 11 &#038; 12 of the Income tax Act there must exist<br />
educational institution. Secondly the educational institute<br />
must exist solely for the purpose of education and not for<br />
the purpose of profit.<br />
27. Considering the elaboration on education above<br />
including that of the judgment by the hons court in the<br />
case of Sole Trustee Loka Shikshana Trust Vs. CIT 101<br />
ITR 234 (SC), it is clear that education in clause 2(15)<br />
refers to the process of training and development of<br />
knowledge, skill, mind and character of student by<br />
normal schooling. It is also clear that the term &#8216;education&#8217;<br />
has a very specific meaning and is not used in a wide and<br />
extended sense and to be within the definition of<br />
education u/s. 2(15), the trust should be an educational<br />
institution which primarily engaged in education activity<br />
and if such trust does not have education activity as<br />
primary activity, it cannot avail examination on the basis<br />
of incidental training activity<br />
28. In the instant case, the appellant trust is admittedly<br />
in promotion of cricket as a game in the state of Gujarat.<br />
Even the plain reading of objects of appellant does not<br />
support the view that the appellant trust is an education<br />
institution. The argument that cricket is a subject in<br />
school under the broad subject of &#8216;Health and Physical<br />
Page 62 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
Education&#8217; cannot make such physical training as<br />
education as it is not scholastic instruction as was held<br />
by the Hon&#8217;ble apex court. To add this chapter is only for<br />
class from Standard VI to Standard IX. Further, this<br />
subject is an optional subject in higher classes as is<br />
evident from both of the certificates from school<br />
submitted by the appellant. I am inclined to state that<br />
merely having a chapter on cricket and that too under a<br />
broad subject &#8216;Health and Physical education&#8217; will not be<br />
suffice to make appellant as &#8216;education institute&#8217;. The A.O<br />
on the other hand amply elaborate the fact that how<br />
appellant is in the promotion of game cricket and has<br />
also highlighted that gross receipt of about 3 crores from<br />
the sale of tickets to general public. Considering the<br />
above facts. I am not inclined to support this argument<br />
with the appellant trust as an educational institution<br />
within the meaning of Section 2(15) of the Incometax<br />
Act.<br />
29. Further, findings made by the A.0. indicates that<br />
the appellant indeed is carrying out charitable activities<br />
which are of the nature of ‘advancement of any other<br />
objective of the general public utility&#8217;. During the course<br />
of scrutiny by the A.O it was established that the<br />
assessee was not doing any &#8216;charitable/educational<br />
activity’ but it was in the business of entertainment of<br />
people at large by arranging/hosting national and<br />
international levels cricket tournaments for a fee/cess.<br />
The A.O has rightly pointed out that the receipts by the<br />
appellant predominantly from the sale of India Vs. Sri<br />
Lanka match amounting to approximately Rs.3 crores<br />
and also other activities indicate that the appellant is<br />
carrying out activities in the nature of trade, commerce<br />
or business.<br />
30. At this point, it may be pointed out that CBDT has<br />
clarified that promotion of sports and games is<br />
considered to be general public utility vide Circular<br />
No.395 dated 24.09.1984. The text of circular is<br />
reproduced below:<br />
SECTION 2(15) CHARITABLE PURPOSE<br />
11. Whether promotion of sports and games can be<br />
considered to be charitable purpose<br />
Page 63 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
1. The expression &#8220;charitable purpose&#8221; is defined in<br />
section 2(15) to include relief of the poor, education,<br />
medical relief and the advancement of any other object<br />
of general public utility.<br />
2. The question whether promotion of sports and<br />
games can be considered as being a charitable purpose<br />
has been examined. The Board are advised that the<br />
advancement of any object beneficial to the public or<br />
section of the public as distinguished from an individual<br />
or group of individuals would be an object of general<br />
public utility. In view thereof, promotion of sports and<br />
games is considered to be a charitable purpose within<br />
the meaning of section 2(15). Therefore, an association<br />
or institution engaged in the promotion of sports and<br />
games can claim exemption under section 11 of the Act,<br />
even if it is not approved under section 10(23) relating to<br />
exemption from tax of sports associations and<br />
institutions having their objects as the promotion,<br />
control, regulation and, encouragement of specified<br />
sports and games.<br />
Circular No. 395 [F. No. 181(5) 82/IT(A-I)], dated 24.9.<br />
1984.<br />
31. I may hasten to add that in Cricket Association of<br />
Bengal Vs. CIT 37 ITR 277 (Calcutta) wherein it was held<br />
that a club formed for the development of promotion of<br />
sports or games or entertainment are held to be not<br />
charitable institution. The head note of the decision is<br />
reproduced as under:<br />
Section 11 of the Income-tax Act 1961 (Corresponding to<br />
section 4(3)(i) of the Indian Income-tax Act 1922)-<br />
Charitable or religious trust Exemption of income from<br />
property held under-Assessment years 1950-51 to 1952-<br />
53 Whether while promotion of games as a part of<br />
education of those who participate in them may be a<br />
charitable purpose, promotion of practice of game in<br />
general either for entertainment of public or for<br />
advancement of game itself could not be held to be<br />
charitable- Held, yes Assessee was an association whose<br />
main object was to promote game of cricket- Another<br />
object authorized assessee to carry out any other<br />
business or activity which might seem to assessee<br />
capable of being carried on in connection with above<br />
Page 64 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
Assessee merely held some demonstration or exhibition<br />
matches and did not provide any training in game of<br />
cricket to novices or any advanced training for persons<br />
who were already practiced players its activities outside<br />
holding matches was limited entirely to its own members<br />
and only contact it had with public was by way of having<br />
them as spectators, on payment of fee, of matches<br />
arranged by it- Whether income that was derived from<br />
fees charged for admission to games held under auspices<br />
of association could not be said to be income derived<br />
from any property- Held, yes Whether further, there was<br />
no general public utility, so as to amount to charity, in<br />
arranging cricket matches which public could see on<br />
payment and hence, assessee was not entitled to<br />
exemption conferred by sections 4(3)(i) and 4(3)(ia) of<br />
1922 Act- Held, yes<br />
32. Section 2(15) of the Act defines ‘charitable<br />
purposes&#8217;. First proviso, thereto with effect from<br />
assessment year 2009-10 laid down that, if any trust etc.<br />
(a) is engaged in pursuing objects of general public utility<br />
(&#8216;other objects&#8217;) and (b) carries on any activity in the<br />
nature of trade, business or commerce or provides any<br />
services in relation to the trade, commerce services or<br />
business and (c) aggregate receipts there from exceed<br />
Rs.25 lacs, it shall be considered that other objects is not<br />
a charitable purpose. If so, such a trust is not eligible for<br />
the exemption inasmuch as the primary condition of<br />
being existing for charitable purpose is not satisfied.<br />
33. With the introduction of Sec. 13(8) of the Act, w.e.f<br />
1/04/2009 (Finance Act 2012), it is clearly evident that<br />
the appellant whose case is squarely covered by the<br />
proviso to Sec 2(15) sha11 forfeit all the exemptions that<br />
are otherwise available u/s 11 and 12 of the Act. The<br />
relevant provisions are as under:<br />
”(8) Nothing contained in section 11 or section 12 Shall<br />
operate so as to exclude any income from the total<br />
income of the previous year of the person in receipt<br />
thereof if the provisions of the first proviso to clause (15)<br />
of section 2 become applicable in the case of such<br />
person in the said previous year.”<br />
The new sub-section (8) provides that the exemption<br />
under section 11 &#038; 12 will not be available to a Trust, in a<br />
Page 65 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
previous year, in which the First proviso to section 2(15)<br />
becomes applicable, for that previous year.<br />
34. Therefore, in the light of the provisions of Sec 13(8)<br />
of the Act, the appellant loses all the exemptions claimed<br />
u/s 11 &#038; 12 of the Act. It is clear from the plain reading of<br />
the said provision that once proviso to Sec 2(15)<br />
becomes applicable to the facts of the case, all the<br />
exemptions otherwise allowable u/s 11 and 12 are not<br />
available to the appellant in that previous year.<br />
35. Considering all the above, I am of the view that the<br />
AO has rightly invoked proviso to Section 2(15) of the<br />
Income-tax Act and denied exemptions u/s 11 &#038; 12 of the<br />
Income tax Act as the appellant trust was engaged in<br />
pursuing objects of general public utility and it carried on<br />
activities in the nature of trade, business or commerce<br />
where the aggregate receipts exceeded Rs.25 lacs.<br />
Accordingly, ground Nos. 1(a) &#038; 1(b) and ground Nos. 2 &#038;<br />
3 are dismissed. “<br />
50. The assessee carried the matter further in appeal before<br />
the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Ahmedabad, Bench &#8216;D&#8217;,<br />
Ahmedabad. The Tribunal, while allowing the appeal preferred<br />
by the assessee-Association, has observed as under;<br />
“34. What essentially follows from the above discussions<br />
is that, even after the 2008 amendment and insertion of<br />
proviso to Section 2(15), so far as ‘any other object of<br />
general public utility&#8217; is concerned, as long as profit<br />
earning is not the predominant purpose of the activity of<br />
the assessee, the benefit of Section 2(15) cannot be<br />
declined. In other words, the accrual of profits to the<br />
assessee, by itself, cannot, therefore, be reason enough<br />
to hold that the assessee is not covered by the definition<br />
of ‘charitable institution’ under section 2(15). Of course,<br />
all these discussions are relevant only for the residuary<br />
clause i.e. “any other object of general public utility”. In<br />
case, therefore, where the objects being pursued by the<br />
assessee is “relief of the poor”, “education” or “medical<br />
relief&#8221;, it is not even material whether or not the<br />
assessee is carrying on an activity in the nature of trade,<br />
commerce or business in the course of such activities.<br />
Page 66 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
The key factor is as to what are the activities of the<br />
assessee institution and as to what these activities seek<br />
to achieve.<br />
35. Let us take a pause here and examine as to what<br />
are the activities of the assessee cricket associations so<br />
as to be brought within the ambit of trade, commerce or<br />
business. We have seen objects of the association, which<br />
are reproduced earlier in our order, and it is not even the<br />
case of the revenue that these objects have anything to<br />
do with any trade, commerce or business; these objects<br />
are simply to promote cricket. The trigger for invoking<br />
proviso to Section 2(15), as Shri Soparkar rightly<br />
contends has to an activity of the assessee which is in<br />
the nature of trade, commerce or business. However, the<br />
case of the revenue authorities hinges on the allegation<br />
that the way and manner in which cricket matches are<br />
being organized, particularly the IPL matches, the activity<br />
of organizing cricket matches is nothing but brute<br />
commerce. Undoubtedly, it would appear that right from<br />
the time Kerry Packer started his World Series Cricket in<br />
1977, there has been no looking back in<br />
commercialization of cricket and the impact of this<br />
commercialization has not left Indian cricket intact. The<br />
Indian Premier League and the rules of the game being<br />
governed by the dictates of commercial considerations<br />
may seem to be one such example of commercialization<br />
of Indian cricket. The difficulty for the case of the<br />
revenue before us, however, is that these matches are<br />
not being organized by the local cricket associations. We<br />
are told that the matches are being organized by the<br />
Board of Cricket Control of India, but then, if we are to<br />
accept this claim and invoke the proviso to Section 2(15)<br />
for this reason, it will amount to a situation in which<br />
proviso to Section 2(15) is being invoked on account of<br />
activities of an entity other than the assesseessomething<br />
which law does not permit. We are not really<br />
concerned, at this stage, whether the allegations about<br />
commercialization of cricket by the BCCI are correct or<br />
not, because that aspect of the matter would be relevant<br />
only for the purpose of proviso to Section 2(15) being<br />
invoked in the hands of the BCCI. We do not wish to deal<br />
with that aspect of the matter or to make any<br />
observations which would prejudge the case of the BCCI.<br />
Suffice to say that the very foundation of revenue’s case<br />
is devoid of legally sustainable basis for the short reason<br />
Page 67 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
that the commercialization of cricket by the BCCI, even if<br />
that be so, cannot be reason enough to invoke the<br />
proviso to Section 2(15). We are alive of the learned<br />
Commissioner (DR)’s suggestion that the cricket<br />
associations cannot be seen on standalone basis as the<br />
BCCI is nothing but an apex body of these cricket<br />
associations at a collective level and whatever BCCI does<br />
is at the behest of or with the connivance of the local<br />
cricket associations, and that it is not the case that<br />
anyone can become a Member of the BCCI because only<br />
a recognized cricket association can become a Member<br />
of the BCCI. We are also alive to learned Commissioner’s<br />
argument that what is being sought to be protected by<br />
the Charitable status of these associations is the share of<br />
these cricket associations from the commercial profits<br />
earned by the BCCI by organizing the cricket matches.<br />
The problem, however, is that the activities of the apex<br />
body; as we have explained earlier, cannot be reason<br />
enough to trigger proviso to Section 2(15) in these cases.<br />
Whether these cricket associations collectively constitute<br />
BCCI or not, in the event of BCCI being involved in<br />
commercial activities, the taxability of such commercial<br />
profits will arise in the hands of the BCCI and not the end<br />
beneficiaries. Even in such a case the point of taxability<br />
of these profits is the BCCI and not the cricket<br />
associations, because, even going by learned<br />
Commissioner’s arguments, these receipts in the hands<br />
of the cricket associations is nothing but appropriation of<br />
profits. What can be taxed is accrual of profits and not<br />
appropriation of profits. In any event, distinction between<br />
the cricket associations and the BCCI cannot be ignored<br />
for the purposes of tax treatment. There is no dispute<br />
that the matches were organized by the BCCI, and the<br />
assessee cannot thus be faulted for the commercial<br />
considerations said to be inherent in planning the<br />
matches. As we make these observations, and as we do<br />
not have the benefit of hearing the perspective of the<br />
BCCI, we make it clear that these observations will have<br />
no bearing on any adjudication in the hands of the BCCI.<br />
Suffice to say that so far as the cricket associations are<br />
concerned, the allegations of the revenue authorities<br />
have no bearing on the denial of the status of ‘charitable<br />
activities’ in the hands of the cricket associations before<br />
us- particularly as learned Commissioner has not been<br />
able to point out a single object of the assessee cricket<br />
associations which is in the nature of trade, commerce or<br />
Page 68 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
business, and, as it is not even in dispute that the objects<br />
being pursued by the assessee cricket associations are<br />
“objects of general public utility”under section 2(15). All<br />
the objects of the assessee cricket associations, as<br />
reproduced earlier in this order, unambiguously seek to<br />
promote the cricket, and this object, as has been all<br />
along accepted by the CBDT itself, an object of general<br />
public utility.<br />
36. Cricket is indeed an immensely popular game in<br />
this part of the world, and anything to do with cricket<br />
results in mass involvement of public at large. The sheer<br />
strength of these numbers results in higher visibility of<br />
cricketing activities and the scale of operations on which<br />
the work for development of cricket is to be carried out.<br />
These facts, by itself, and without the assessees before<br />
us deviating from their objects or venturing into trade,<br />
commerce or business, cannot require the activities to be<br />
treated as commercial activities. When a cricket stadium<br />
is to be built, it has to accommodate a very large number<br />
of persons but the size of the stadium would not mean<br />
that the activity is for anything other than promotion of<br />
cricket.. When the numbers are large, the scale of<br />
operations is large, and when scale of operations are<br />
larger, even the surplus or deficit could be large, but then<br />
the scale of operations may be a scale on which<br />
commercial activities could be carried out but that fact<br />
cannot convert an object of general public utility into a<br />
commercial activity. We have carefully analyzed the<br />
annual reports and the annual financial statements of the<br />
assessee, and we do not find any objects, other than<br />
objects of the cricket associations, being pursed by these<br />
cricket associations. The objects of these cricket<br />
associations clearly demonstrate that these cricket<br />
associations exist and operate purely for the purpose of<br />
promoting cricket. We are, therefore, of the considered<br />
view that the proviso to Section 2(15) has been wrongly<br />
invoked in these cases.<br />
41. We have noted that all the learned representatives<br />
have advanced detailed arguments on the proposition<br />
that since the assessee cricket associations are engaged<br />
in educational activities, it is not really material whether<br />
or not the assessee has engaged itself in the activities in<br />
the nature of trade, commerce or business. However, in<br />
the light of our categorical finding that the assessee<br />
Page 69 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
cricket associations were not really engaged in the<br />
activities in the nature of trade, commerce or business, it<br />
is not really necessary to adjudicate on this plea. We<br />
leave the question open for adjudication in a flt case.<br />
Conclusions on this issue:<br />
42. For the detailed reasons set out above, we are of<br />
the considered view that the authorities below were in<br />
error in invoking the proviso to Section 2(15) and thus in<br />
declining the benefit of Section 11 and 12 to the<br />
appellant cricket associations. To this extent, plea of the<br />
appellants must be upheld. We uphold the plea. “<br />
51. Being dissatisfied with the order passed by the ITAT,<br />
Ahmedabad, &#8216;D&#8217; Bench, Ahmedabad, the Revenue is here<br />
before this Court with the present tax appeal.<br />
Submissions on behalf of the Revenue:-<br />
52. Mr. M.R. Bhatt, the learned senior counsel appearing for<br />
the Revenue vehemently submitted that the ITAT committed<br />
a serious error in passing the impugned order. Mr. Bhatt would<br />
submit that by any stretch of imagination, the activities of the<br />
assessee do not fall within the definition of the term<br />
“charitable purpose” as defined under Section 2(15) of the<br />
Act. Mr. Bhatt submitted that the activities, in no manner,<br />
could be said to be for the purpose of promotion of sports<br />
(game of cricket). Mr. Bhatt would submit that the activities<br />
of the Association are in the nature of business. The<br />
Association derives huge profit by hosting international cricket<br />
matches in the stadium. Mr. Bhatt would submit that the<br />
Association receives a huge amount from the BCCI for the<br />
purpose of organizing the international matches. Mr. Bhatt<br />
would submit that the registration of the Association under<br />
Page 70 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
Section 12A of the Act will not make the assessee<br />
automatically eligible to seek exemption under Section 11 of<br />
the Act. Mr. Bhatt submitted that howsoever laudable the<br />
objects of the trust may be, but the activities undertaken by<br />
such trust are to be looked into for the purpose of deciding<br />
whether such trust is entitled to be called a charitable trust<br />
within the meaning of Section 2(15) of the Act and is liable to<br />
claim exemption under Sections 11 and 12 of the Act or not.<br />
53. According to Mr. Bhatt, the Tribunal has not discussed<br />
the relevant issues in their true perspective and, therefore, the<br />
matters should be remitted to the Tribunal for fresh<br />
consideration of all the relevant aspects. According to Mr.<br />
Bhatt, although the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal is a fact<br />
finding Tribunal and if it arrives at its own conclusions of fact<br />
after due consideration of the evidence before it, this Court<br />
may not interfere, yet it is necessary, however, that every fact<br />
for and against the assessee must have been considered with<br />
due care and the Tribunal is obliged to give its finding in a<br />
manner which would clearly indicate what were the questions<br />
which arose for determination, what was the evidence pro and<br />
contra in regard to each one of them and what were the<br />
findings recorded on the evidence on record before it.<br />
According to Mr. Bhatt, when the Assessing Officer and the CIT<br />
(A) have assigned cogent reasons for the purpose of coming to<br />
the conclusion that the activities of the assessee cannot be<br />
termed as charitable and the case of the assessee is covered<br />
within the Proviso to the fourth limb of Section 2(15) of the Act,<br />
then to upset such findings, the Tribunal was expected to<br />
assign cogent reasons. Mr. Bhatt, in support of this submission,<br />
has placed reliance on a decision of the Supreme Court in the<br />
Page 71 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
case of Omar Salay Mohamed Sait vs. CIT, reported in<br />
(1959) 371 ITR 151 (SC), in which the Supreme Court<br />
succinctly expressed the expectation from a Tribunal while<br />
deciding such appeals. The following observations of the<br />
Supreme Court have been relied upon by Mr. Bhatt;<br />
&#8220;We are aware that the Income Tax Appellate-Tribunal is<br />
a fact finding Tribunal and if it arrives at its own<br />
conclusion of fact after due consideration of the evidence<br />
before it this court will not interfere. It is necessary,<br />
however, that every fact for and against the assessee<br />
must have been considered with due care and the<br />
Tribunal must have given its finding in a manner which<br />
would clearly indicate what were the questions which<br />
arose for determination, what was the evidence pro and<br />
contra in regard to each one of them and what were the<br />
findings reached on the evidence on record before it. The<br />
conclusions reached by the Tribunal should not be<br />
coloured by any irrelevant considerations or matters of<br />
prejudice and if there are any circumstances which<br />
required to be explained by the assessee, the assessee<br />
should be given an opportunity of doing so. On no<br />
account whatever should the Tribunal base its findings on<br />
suspicions, conjectures or surmises nor should it act on<br />
no evidence at all or on improper rejection of material<br />
and relevant evidence or partly on evidence and partly<br />
on suspicions, conjectures or surmises and if it does<br />
anything of the sort, its findings, even though on<br />
questions of fact, will be liable to be set aside by this<br />
court.&#8221;<br />

Submissions on behalf of the assessee:<br />
55. On the other hand, Mr. J.P. Shah, the learned senior<br />
counsel appearing on behalf of the assessee has vehemently<br />
opposed this tax appeal. Mr. Shah submitted that no error,<br />
not to speak of any error of law, could be said to have been<br />
committed by the ITAT in passing the impugned order. Mr.<br />
Shah submitted that the assessee is engaged in the activities<br />
of promoting the game of cricket. In other words, according to<br />
Mr. Shah, the assessee is engaged in promotion of sports. Mr.<br />
Shah brought to our notice the following relevant facts;<br />
“1, GCA has given following renowned players to Indian<br />
Cricket:<br />
Mr. Jashubhai Patel,<br />
Mr. Parthiv Patel,<br />
Mr.Jasprit Bumrah,<br />
Mr. Axar Patel<br />
The above named cricketers have been rendered<br />
coaching and training by GCA.<br />
Mr. Jashubhai Patel, Mr. Parthiv Patel and Mr. Axar Patel<br />
have played as the members of the Indian Cricket Team<br />
in Cricket matches against Foreign Teams in the past.<br />
Mr. Jasprit Bumrah is currently a star Cricketer in Indian<br />
Cricket Team in International Cricket and is ranked as<br />
World No.1 bowler.<br />
Apart from the above players, Mr. Priyank Panchal is a<br />
renowned Ranji Trophy player playing for the GCA at<br />
present and is knocking on the doors of International<br />
cricket.<br />
All the above players have been coached by the GCA.<br />
Page 74 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
2. GCA has the following Cricket teams for Men.<br />
(a) Under 14 years<br />
(b) Under 16 years<br />
(c) Under 19 years<br />
(d) Under 23 years<br />
(e) Seniors Ranji Trophy Team, Duleep Trophy, etc.<br />
There are cricket teams for women also.<br />
4. GCA has employed former national level cricketers<br />
as coaches for each of all the above stated segments of<br />
cricket teams, i.e. a coach appointed for under 14 team<br />
would look after coaching of that team only.<br />
5. GCA looks after the cricketing activities in the following<br />
eleven districts/provinces of the Gujarat State.<br />
(I) Ahmedabad<br />
(ii) Ghandhinagar<br />
(iii) Kheda<br />
(iv) Surat<br />
(v) Bulsar(Balsad)<br />
(vi) Bharuch I<br />
(vii) Anand<br />
(viii) Banaskantha<br />
(ix) Daman<br />
(x) Dadar Nagar Haveli<br />
(xi) Panchmahal.<br />
6. Currently the GCA has employed former Indian Team<br />
Cricketer, Mr. Sairaj Bhautule, as coach for the Seniors<br />
i.e. GCA Ranji Trophy Team Players etc. He is also<br />
responsible for co-ordinating with the coaches of other<br />
age group segment teams of GCA.<br />
7. Coaching of Cricketers encompasses the following<br />
aspects :<br />
(a) Skill development in nuances of Cricketing.<br />
(b) Physical development,<br />
(c) Mental development,<br />
(d) Building Personality of a Cricketer.<br />
8. It is a known fact that each large size school has its<br />
Page 75 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
own cricket team where the players are mostly under 14<br />
years in age.<br />
These schools play inter-school cricket and compete with<br />
each other for cricket shield for best school team. From<br />
these championships, talent is spotted by GCA and<br />
invited for coaching and training. The budding cricketers<br />
are coached by renowned past cricketers and their talent<br />
is nurtured.<br />
9. The coach monitors the progress of players and<br />
trains them for overcoming their deficiencies so that<br />
each one of them progresses and is able to shine at<br />
national level.<br />
In Physical development, generally the following tests<br />
are done as an ongoing process.<br />
(a) Fitness Test under which the MSK is done, i.e.,<br />
Muscular, Skeleton Test.<br />
(b) Endurance Test,<br />
(c ) Agility Test.<br />
Players are informed of their deficiencies and during the<br />
training sessions, the coaches concentrate for removal of<br />
such deficiencies e.g. If one of the shoulders is not strong<br />
enough, the coach would suggest to and supervise the<br />
player for undertaking specific exercises to strengthen<br />
the shoulder.<br />
In Skill development the player is shown videos of his<br />
actions. Coach points out the deficiency and would<br />
suggest corrective actions. e.g. if a batsman needs<br />
improvement in his batting stance, the same will be<br />
captured in the video first and thereafter it would be<br />
shown to him for corrective action. There is one to one<br />
discussion with each player for improvement in his game<br />
and this is an on going process.<br />
In Mental development, the coach has one to one<br />
discussion with all the players to know about their<br />
deficiencies like getting nervous while facing opening<br />
bowling spell etc. Curative actions are taken by coach.<br />
Page 76 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
Players are also trained to face media, e.g., if a cricketer<br />
is awarded &#8216;Man of the match trophy&#8217; then how to face<br />
interview etc.<br />
Coaching and Support Staff at present.<br />
GCA has employed at present following personnel;<br />

(b) Physios 6<br />
(c ) Trainers 5<br />
(d) Video Analyst 2<br />
(e) Pitch Curator 1<br />

56. Mr. Shah submitted that the Association received corpus<br />
donation of Rs.20,69,60,338/- from the BCCI. The Assessing<br />
Officer held that it is not corpus donation and added the same<br />
to the income. Before the C.I.T (Appeals), the Association drew<br />
the attention to a letter addressed to the Officer dated 28th<br />
December, 2011 where two specific letters from the BCCI<br />
dated 12th October, .2001 and 13th October, 2001 respectively<br />
addressed to the Secretary of Gujarat Cricket Association were<br />
produced. The letter dated 12th October, 2001 from the BCCI<br />
draws attention to the decision in the Annual General Meeting,<br />
and the resolution incorporating the said decision as follows<br />
[reproduced at page 59 of the order of CIT (A)]<br />
“5. Chairman suggested that as already decided in<br />
working Committee henceforth the TV subsidies should<br />
be sent towards &#8216;Corpus Fund&#8217; and this decision can also<br />
be approved by the members of this meeting. Thereafter<br />
the members unanimously approved that henceforth the<br />
TV subsidies should be sent by the Board to the Member<br />
Associations towards “Corpus Fund” instead of subsidy<br />
fund.”<br />
Page 77 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
57. Mr. Shah submitted that the C.I.T.(Appeals), in his order,<br />
in para-18 on page 65 noted that the above “donation of<br />
Rs.1,38,36,800/- was treated as the Corpus donation in A.Y.<br />
2002-03.”. The above resolution mentioned in the letter of<br />
BCCI dated 12th October, 2001, which used the word<br />
“henceforth”, which means in future also, was not considered<br />
good enough by him as “a specific direction” as required by<br />
section 11(1)(d) and only on that reasoning, he held that It Is<br />
not the corpus donation. The Department did not file appeal<br />
against the said decision but the Association did file an appeal<br />
to the Tribunal against the finding of absence of specific<br />
direction in every year. The Tribunal, on page 242, para-49<br />
reproduced from their order in A.Ys. 2004-05 to 2007-08<br />
pointing out that “similar amounts received in the earlier years<br />
have been treated all along as the corpus donation”. ‘Earlier<br />
Year’ means A.Ys. 2002-03 and 2003-04. On page 245, the<br />
Tribunal reproduced para-15 of their order for A.Ys. 2004-05 to<br />
2007-08 as follows:<br />
&#8220;15. We find that, at pages 46 and 47 of the paperbook,<br />
the assessee has filed specific confirmations to the effect<br />
that these amounts were corpus donations. We have also<br />
perused the BCCI resolution no 5 dated 29th September<br />
2001 which specifically states that the TV subsidies<br />
should henceforth be sent to the Member Associations<br />
towards “corpus funds&#8221;. There is no dispute that the TV<br />
subsidy in question is sent under this resolution. On<br />
these facts, and In the light of the provisions of Section<br />
11(1)(d) which only require the income to be “by way of<br />
voluntary contributions made with a specific direction<br />
that they shall form part of the corpus of the trust or the<br />
institution”, we are of the considered view that any<br />
payments made by the BCCI, without a legal obligation<br />
and with a specific direction that it shall be for corpus<br />
fund as admittedly the present receipt is, is required to<br />
be treated as corpus donation not includible in total<br />
Page 78 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
income. We are unable to find any legal support for<br />
learned CIT(A)&#8217;s stand that each donation must be<br />
accompanied by a separate written document. The<br />
contribution has to be voluntary and it has to be with<br />
specific direction that it will form corpus of the trust’.<br />
These conditions are clearly satisfied. Any payment<br />
which the assessee is not under an obligation to make,<br />
whatever be the mode of its computation, is a voluntary<br />
payment, and, any payment which is with a specific<br />
direction that it for corpus fund is a corpus donation. In<br />
our considered view, even without the two specific<br />
confirmations filed by the assessee, in the light of the<br />
BCCI resolution under which the payment is made and in<br />
the light of the payment not being under any legal<br />
obligation, the conditions under section 11(1)(d) are<br />
satisfied. We, therefore, uphold the plea of the assessee.<br />
The Assessing Officer is accordingly directed to delete<br />
this addition of Rs.1,58,00,000.”<br />
58. Mr. Shah submitted that in view of the fact that in the<br />
A.Ys. 2002-03 and 2003-04, the Assessing Officer accepted on<br />
the same facts and evidence of the above two letters and<br />
resolution, the identical donations to be corpus donations, It<br />
was not open for the revenue to take a contrary view and hold<br />
to the contrary in the succeeding assessment years i.e. A.Ys.<br />
2004-05 to 2012-13 in view of the Supreme Court decision of<br />
CIT vs. Excel Industries Ltd. (2013) 358 ITR 295, which<br />
applied the rule of consistency of approach to the same issue<br />
arising in all other Assessment Years. The Supreme Court in<br />
the aforesaid decision has observed “the Revenue cannot be<br />
allowed to flip-flop on the issue”.<br />
59. Mr. Shah further submitted that the Tribunal has rightly<br />
construed the word “henceforth&#8221; used in the resolution as<br />
covering up all the payments in the future years by citing the<br />
decision of CIT (Exemption) vs. Mata Amrithanandamayi<br />
Math- (2017) 85 taxmann.com 261 (Ker), holding that once<br />
Page 79 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
the assessee donated the principal and the future interest to<br />
the corpus account, every year, specific direction regarding<br />
interest is not necessary.<br />
60. Mr. Shah submitted that the following Question (D) is only<br />
for the A.Y.2009-10:<br />
“Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case and<br />
in law, the Appellate Tribunal was justified in deleting the<br />
addition made on account of infrastructure subsidy of<br />
Rs.2,13,34,033/-, treating it as capital receipts without<br />
appreciating the findings of the Assessing Officer”<br />
61. Mr. Shah further submitted that in respect of the<br />
aforesaid disallowance, the Assessing Officer in his order has<br />
observed as follows:<br />
“Corpus Donation under the heading “Infrastructure<br />
Subsidy” received from BCCI: The assessee during the<br />
year under assessment, has received infrastructure<br />
subsidy from BCCI for Rs.3,52,86,521/- and has utilized<br />
Rs.1,39,52,488/- by way of payment to District Cricket<br />
Association and hence balance amount of<br />
Rs.2,13,34,033/- is added to the assessee’s total income<br />
in view of the detailed discussion made in para 5, 6 &#038; 7<br />
above.”<br />
62. Mr. Shah also submitted that the C.I.T. (Appeals) agreed<br />
with the Assessing Officer and the Tribunal on the appeal being<br />
disposed off on the issue in favour of the Respondent in para-<br />
55 at page 249 as follows:<br />
“55. On a perusal of the BCCI Infrastructure Subsidy<br />
rules, we find that what is given to the assessee as<br />
infrastructure subsidy is reimbursement of 50% of costs<br />
in respect of certain expenditure on infrastructure which<br />
is inherently in the capital field. The mere fact that it is<br />
not a reimbursement to an outside party, such as a<br />
district cricket association, does not really matter. As<br />
Page 80 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
long as the subsidy is relatable to a capital asset created<br />
by the assessee on his own or by an eligible district<br />
cricket association, as the present subsidy undisputedly<br />
is, it is outside the ambit of revenue receipt and taxable<br />
income. The very foundation of the stand of the<br />
Assessing Officer is thus devoid of legally sustainable<br />
merits. As such, there can hardly be an occasion, in<br />
principle, to hold such a subsidy as a revenue receipt or<br />
taxable income. There is not even a whisper of a<br />
discussion by the Assessing officer to the effect that<br />
infrastructure subsidy is revenue in nature. As a matter<br />
of fact, the claim is made for the subsidy only after the<br />
expenditure having been incurred. The authorities below<br />
have simply brushed aside the case and the submissions<br />
of the assessee and proceeded to hold it as an income.<br />
Looking to the nature of the subsidy, which is clearly<br />
relatable to the capital assets generated, we are unable<br />
to hold this receipt in the revenue field. We, therefore,<br />
uphold the plea of the assessee on this point as well and<br />
delete the addition of Rs 2,13,34,033/-.”<br />
63. Mr. Shah, in regard to the common question In the A.Ys.<br />
2004-05 to 2008-09 pertaining to allowing of the benefit of<br />
exemption u/s.11, submitted that if the Respondent succeeds<br />
in the Tax Appeal No.268 of 2012, the aforesaid question in the<br />
above appeals for the A.Ys 2004-05 to 2008-09 will have to be<br />
answered in favour of the assessee<br />
64. Mr. Shah further submitted that the activity other than<br />
the International match for the A.Ys. 2009-10 to 2012-13<br />
entrusted by the BCCI Invariably have resulted into deficit and<br />
this activity goes on round the year without a break. It is only if<br />
the activity is a one day International match or twenty-twenty<br />
or five days test match that there may be a surplus but one or<br />
two matches cannot convert the altruistic activity of the<br />
Association into trade or business. The activities carried on by<br />
the Gujarat Cricket Association are enumerated at para-19 of<br />
the Tribunal’s order.<br />
Page 81 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
65. Mr. Shah submitted that the findings of the Tribunal are<br />
very clear on the controversy. The Tribunal, after due<br />
consideration of all the relevant aspects, concludes; “We are,<br />
therefore, of the considered view that the Proviso to section<br />
2(15) had been wrongly Invoked In these cases.”<br />
66. Mr. Shah submitted that even prior to the amendment of<br />
section 2(15) w.e.f. 01.04.2019 i.e. the A.Y. 2009-10, the<br />
following provision, sub-section (4A) in section 11, inserted<br />
w.e.f. 01.04.1992 was in the statute book:<br />
“11(4A) Sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) or subsection<br />
(3) or sub-section (3A) shall not apply in relation to any<br />
income of a trust or an institution, being profits and gains<br />
of business, unless the business is incidental to the<br />
attainment of the objectives of the trust or, as the case<br />
may be, institution, and separate books of account are<br />
maintained by such trust or institution in respect of such<br />
business.”<br />
67. Mr. Shah submitted that inspite of the facts being<br />
identical in the years, A.Y. 2009-10 and preceding to A.Y. 2009-<br />
10 and in A.Ys. 2008-09, 2007-08 backward upto 2002-03,<br />
there is total absence of finding of application of sec.11(4A) or<br />
finding of business in all these years prior to A.Y. 2009-10. This<br />
very aspect goes to show that the Assessing Officer is not<br />
consistent and the rule of consistency laid down by the<br />
Supreme Court in CIT vs. Excel Industries Ltd. (2013) 358 ITR<br />
295 very much applies in A.Ys. 2009-10 and onward.<br />
68. Mr. Shah placed strong reliance on the following<br />
documentary evidences also looked into by the ITAT.<br />
Page 82 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
“(i) Note in the form of summary of activities other than<br />
the international match entrusted by the BCCI;<br />
(ii) List of matches played in A.Y.2009-10<br />
(iii) Income &#038; Expenditure for A.Y. 2009-10 including<br />
the income of Rs.1,51,97,741/- from India vs. South<br />
Africa Test Match, yet resulting into loss of Rs.5,91,708/-<br />
accepted by the Assessing Officer in his assessment<br />
order u/s. 143(3).<br />
(iv) Break-up of remuneration of the support staff in<br />
current years&#8217; cricket season 2019-20 of Rs.49,20,000/-.<br />
(v) Break-up of remuneration of coaches in current<br />
years&#8217; cricket season 2019-20 of Rs.95,00,000/-”<br />
69. Mr. Shah has placed strong reliance on the following two<br />
decisions;<br />
“(i) In the case of Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Excel<br />
Industries Ltd., (2013) 358 ITR 295 (SC);<br />
(ii) In the case of Commissioner of Income Tax,<br />
(Exemption) vs. Mata Amrithanandamayi Math, (2017)<br />
85 taxmann.com 261 (Kerala);<br />
70. Mr. Shah also brought to our notice the following;<br />
“1(a) The learned Assessing Officer has not found any<br />
defect in books of account. In his Assessment Order, he<br />
starts with the figure of (-) Rs.5,91,708/against which he<br />
has stated thus: “Excess of income over expenditure”.<br />
(b) Analysis of Income and Expenditure account which is<br />
accepted by AO is as follows.<br />
2. GCA has incurred total expenditure of<br />
Rs.4,03,98,737/- as per audited Income and Expenditure<br />
A/c. GCA has receipts of Rs.3,98,07,028/-. The net result<br />
is loss i.e. Excess of Expenditure over Income of<br />
Rs.5,91,709/-, i.e. there is a deficit.<br />
Page 83 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
3. The Receipt side comprises of following heads of<br />
receipts as summarized from Income and Expenditure<br />
A/c.<br />
Rs.<br />
(I) International Cricket Match Surplus 1,51,97,741/-<br />
(ii) Bank FDR Interest 2,21,88,527/-<br />

of Expenses as summarized:<br />
(i) Match Expenses [Local Matches] 1,70,84,594/-<br />

(iii) Administration and Other Expenses 79,23,818/-<br />
4,03,98,737/-<br />
5. From the above summary, it is quite clear that;<br />
Surplus income from International matches is less than<br />
expense incurred for Local Matches.<br />
(a) Cricketing expenses incurred by Rs.<br />
GCA for domestic matches other than<br />
International Matches where no fees<br />
are charged.<br />

BARODA CRICKET ASSOCIATION:-<br />
72. We shall now proceed to the Tax Appeals Nos.320 of<br />
2019, 321 of 2019, 374 of 2019 and 675 of 2019 respectively.<br />
73. In these tax appeals, the assessee is the Baroda Cricket<br />
Association. In these appeals also Mr. Bhatt, the learned<br />
Page 85 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
senior counsel has reiterated the very same submissions as<br />
canvassed in the Tax Appeal No.317 of 2019.<br />
74. The Tax Appeal No.320 of 2019 is treated as the lead<br />
matter. This appeal was ordered to be admitted on the<br />
following substantial questions of law;<br />
“[A] Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case<br />
and in law, the Appellate Tribunal was justified in<br />
allowing the benefit of exemptions u/s.11 &#038; 12 of the Act<br />
without considering the fact that the assessee is involved<br />
in widespread commercial activities in nature of business<br />
and the activities of the assessee is covered under first<br />
and second proviso to section 2(15) of the Act?<br />
[B]. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case<br />
and in law, the Appellate Tribunal was justified in<br />
deleting the addition made in respect of corpus donation<br />
u/s.11(1)(d) of the Act without appreciating that the<br />
assessee failed to discharge its onus by not bringing<br />
anything on record in support of its claim of corpus<br />
donation?”<br />
75. Mr. Soparkar, the learned senior counsel appearing for<br />
the Baroda Cricket Association, by an large, adopted all the<br />
submissions of Mr. Shah, the learned senior counsel who has<br />
argued on behalf of the Gujarat Cricket Association. However,<br />
Mr. Soparkar has something to add over and above what has<br />
been submitted by Mr.J.P. Shah, the learned senior counsel<br />
appearing for the Gujarat Cricket Association.<br />
76. Mr. Soparkar submitted that the objects as well as the<br />
actual activities carried out by the Baroda Cricket Association<br />
are for the education in the field of cricket as well as promotion<br />
and development of the sport of cricket (object of general<br />
public utility) not being in the nature of trade, commerce or<br />
business. Mr. Soparkar invited our attention to the objects of<br />
Page 86 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
the Baroda Cricket Association set out as per clause (4) of its<br />
Memorandum of Association. The objects are as under;<br />
“(a) To promote develop &#038; encourage cricket within its<br />
jurisdiction.<br />
(b) To arrange and promote the establishment of Cricket<br />
clubs within its jurisdiction.<br />
(c) To directly control and manage all cricket activities<br />
within its jurisdiction.<br />
(d) To pay special attention and care to the<br />

(e) To arrange for good cricket ground and maintain the<br />

(f) To popularize the game of cricket within its jurisdiction<br />
by organizing and/or conducting and/or controlling<br />

(h) To start or sponsor and/or to subscribe to funds or to<br />

(i) To borrow or raise money which may be required for<br />

(j) To collect funds and to utilize the same in such<br />

players for important matches.<br />
(n) To do any other acts in furtherance of the above<br />
objects not inconsistent there with.”<br />
77. Mr. Soparkar, thereafter, invited our attention to the fact<br />
that to meet with the aforesaid objects, the Baroda Cricket<br />
Association incurs the following types of expenditure.<br />
“(i) Local tournament expense- cricketing tournament<br />
(ii) District cricket expense- to promote game of cricket<br />
in our jurisdictional districts.<br />

into the activities of seminar, training, meetings, exhibition,<br />
etc. for the coaches, umpires, trainers, physics, scorers, and<br />
other cricketing support staff for the purpose of promoting the<br />
game of cricket. Mr. Soparkar also invited our attention to the<br />
annual report of the Association. Mr. Soparkar, in support of his<br />
submissions, has placed reliance on three decisions;.<br />
(i) Ahmedabad Urban Development Authority, 2017<br />
396 ITR 323 (Gujarat);<br />
(ii) Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation, 2017<br />
83 taxmann.com 366 (Gujarat)<br />
(iii) Naroda Enviro Projects Limited (Gujarat), Tax<br />
Appeal No. 189 of 2019;<br />
Page 89 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
80. Mr. Soparkar submitted that in carrying on the activities,<br />
certain surplus may ensue. The earning of surplus itself would<br />
not mean that the appellant existed for profit. ‘Profits’ means<br />
that surplus over which the owners of the entity have a right to<br />
withdraw for any purpose including the personal purpose.<br />
Profit making would therefore means private profit. Profit<br />
making would not mean the surplus that results from certain<br />
activities for which the organization is devoted is ploughed<br />
back for the promotion of the very same activities.<br />
81. Mr. Soparkar submitted that the Assessee Association has<br />
not distributed any profits outside the organization. All the<br />
profits are ploughed back into the very activities of education<br />
and promotion and development of the sport of cricket and<br />
therefore the Assessee cannot be termed to be carrying out<br />
commercial activities in the nature of trade, commerce or<br />
business:<br />
82. Mr. Soparkar submitted that the case of the Revenue is<br />
that the appellant is an alter ego of BCCI. Assessee receives<br />
“share of income” from the BCCI and therefore the activities of<br />
the BCCI are the activities of the assessee. Further the<br />
activities of the BCCI are commercial in nature. The activities<br />
of the BCCI is the exhibition of sports and to earn profit out of<br />
it. It is only when such exhibition of substantial part of the<br />
income of the assessee is coming from the BCCI and therefore<br />
necessarily the receipts of the assessee partake character of<br />
commercial nature.<br />
83. Mr. Soparkar submitted that the state cricket associations<br />
and the BCCI are distinct taxable units and must be treated as<br />
Page 90 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
such, as there is no provision in the law that a member body<br />
can be held liable for taxation on account of the activities of<br />
the apex body.<br />
84. Mr. Soparkar submitted that irrespective of the nature of<br />
the activities of the BCCI (Commercial or Charitable) what is<br />
pertinent for determining the nature of the activates of the<br />
assessee is the object and activates of the assessee and not<br />
that of the BCCI. The nature of the activities of the assessee<br />
cannot take its colour from the nature of the activities of the<br />
donor. Examples are plenty where a corporate house supports<br />
activities of a Hospital or a School. Simply because the<br />
corporate house is not a charitable organization, the Hospital<br />
or the school doesn’t cease to remain charitable.<br />
85. Mr. Soparkar submitted that even if the BCCI is held to be<br />
involved in carrying out the commercial activities, the<br />
disbursements from the BCCl to the cricket associations cannot<br />
become commercial profits of the assessee cricket<br />
associations liable to be taxed. It is again urged that the<br />
trigger for denial of Section 2(15) benefit, or for the proviso to<br />
Section 2 (15) being invoked, is the activity of the assessee<br />
and not an outsider.<br />
86. With respect to the question relating to the corpus<br />
donation received by the Association from the BCCI and<br />
claimed as exempt by the assessee under Section 11(1)(d) of<br />
the Act, Mr. Soparkar submitted that according to the Revenue,<br />
there is no specific direction from the BCCI to treat the said<br />
amount towards the corpus donation and, in such<br />
circumstances, the same cannot be considered as “corpus<br />
donation” and the same should be treated as income of the<br />
Page 91 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
assessee not exempt under Section 11(1)(d) of the Act.<br />
According to Mr. Soparkar, such stance of the Revenue is not<br />
sustainable in law.<br />
87. Mr. Soparkar submitted that the ITAT has followed its<br />
earlier decision in the case of Gujarat Cricket Association for<br />
the A.Ys.2004-05 to 2007-08 (ITA 1253/Ahd/2013), wherein the<br />
ITAT held as under;<br />
“1. The assessee has filed specific confirmations to the<br />
effect that these amounts were corpus donations.<br />
2. BCCI resolution no 5 dated 29th September 2001<br />
specifically states that the TV subsidies should<br />
henceforth be sent to the Member Associations towards<br />
“corpus funds”. There is no dispute that the TV subsidy in<br />
question is sent under this resolution. This resolution<br />
includes the present assessee-Baroda Cricket Association<br />
as well.<br />
3. On these facts, and in the light of the provisions of<br />
Section 11(1)(d) which only require the income to be “by<br />
way of voluntary contributions made with a specific<br />
direction that they shall form part of the corpus of the<br />
trust or the institution”, Tribunal was of the considered<br />
view that any payments made by the BCCI, without a<br />
legal obligation and with a specific direction that it shall<br />
be for corpus fund as admittedly the present receipt is, is<br />
required to be treated as corpus donation not includible<br />
in total income.<br />
4. There is no legal support for leamed CIT(A)’s stand<br />
that each donation must be accompanied by a separate<br />
written document.<br />
5. The contribution has to be voluntary and it has to be<br />
with specific direction that it will form corpus of the<br />
trust’. These conditions are clearly satisfied. Any<br />
payment which the assessee is not under an obligation to<br />
make, whatever be the mode of its computation, is a<br />
voluntary payment, and, any payment which is with a<br />
specific direction that it for corpus fund is a corpus<br />
donation.<br />
Page 92 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
6. Therefore, even without the two specific<br />
confirmations filed by the assessee, in the light of the<br />
BCCI resolution under which the payment is made and in<br />
the light of the payment not being under any legal<br />
obligation, the conditions under section 11(1)(d) are<br />
satisfied.”<br />
88. In such circumstances, referred to above, Mr. Soparkar<br />
submits that the Tribunal has correctly found on facts and in<br />
law that the said amount is towards the corpus fund and,<br />
therefore, the same will be exempted under Section 11(1)(d)<br />
of the Act, 1961.<br />
SAURASHTRA CRICKET ASSOCIATION:-<br />
89. We shall now take up the Tax Appeals Nos.358-360 of<br />
2019. In these two tax appeals, the respondent-assessee is<br />
the Saurashtra Cricket Association.<br />
90. The Tax Appeal No.358 of 2019 is treated as the lead<br />
matter. This tax appeal was ordered to be admitted on the<br />
following substantial questions of law;<br />
“[A]. Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of<br />
the case the Appellate Tribunal was justified in allowing<br />
the benefit of Sections 11 and 12 when the Assessing<br />
Officer has clearly brought on record that assessee is<br />
covered under the proviso to Section 2(15) r.w.s 13(8) of<br />
the Act?<br />
[B]. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case<br />
and in law, the Appellate Tribunal was justified in<br />
directing the Assessing Officer to allow the claim of<br />
accumulation of Rs.5,37,04,677/- under section 11(1)(a)<br />
and Rs.23,44,45,000/- under section 11(2) of the Act<br />
without appreciating the findings of the Assessing Officer<br />
with regard to applicability of section 2(15) of the Act?<br />
[C]. Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case<br />
Page 93 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
and in law, the Appellate Tribunal was justified in<br />
remitting the issue of infrastructure subsidy of<br />
Rs.4,57,95,448/- back to the file of the Assessing Officer,<br />
without appreciating the findings of the Assessing<br />
Officer?”<br />
91. Mr. Tushar Hemani, the learned senior counsel appearing<br />
for the respondent-assessee has, by and large, adopted all the<br />
submissions canvassed by Mr. J.P. Shah, the learned senior<br />
counsel appearing for the Gujarat Cricket Association and Mr.<br />
Soparkar, the learned senior counsel appearing for the Baroda<br />
Cricket Association. However, Mr. Hemani added something<br />
important of his own to what has been submitted on behalf of<br />
the other two Associations. His submissions are broadly as<br />
under;<br />
“I) Imparting training in sports is an educational<br />
activity and hence not an object of general public<br />
utility. Hence, the proviso to Section 2(15) of the<br />
Act is not applicable at all.<br />
II) Alternatively and without prejudice:<br />
a. The activities carried out by the Respondent<br />
are in the nature of “general public utility.”<br />
b. Mere generation of surplus does not add the<br />
element of “trade, commerce or business” to<br />
an otherwise charitable activity.<br />
III) Where two views are possible, view in favour<br />
of the assessee should be adopted.<br />
The aforesaid is elaborated as follows:<br />
I) Imparting training in sports is nothing but<br />
education activity and therefore the Respondent<br />
would fall in the first limb of definition of<br />
“charitable purpose” as defined u/s.2(15) of the<br />
Act and not under the residual clause of ‘the<br />
advancement of any other object of general public<br />
Page 94 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
utility’. If that be the situation, proviso to Section<br />
2(15) would not apply at all.<br />
Section 2(15):<br />
“charitable purpose” includes relief of the poor, education,<br />
yoga, medical relief, preservation of environment (including<br />
watersheds, forests and wildlife) and preservation of<br />
monuments or places or objects of artistic or historic<br />
interest, and the advancement of any other object of<br />
general public utility:<br />
Provided that the advancement of any other object of<br />
general public utility shall not be a charitable<br />
purpose, if it involves the carrying on of any activity in the<br />
nature of trade, commerce or business, or any activity of<br />
rendering any service in relation to any trade, commerce or<br />
business, for a cess or fee or any other consideration,<br />
irrespective of the nature of use or application, or<br />
retention, of the income from such activity:<br />
Provided further that the first proviso shall not apply if the<br />
aggregate value of the receipts from the activities referred<br />
to therein is twenty-five lakh rupees or less in the previous<br />
year;<br />
It is submitted that it is a settled position that<br />
“education” is a term with a very wide meaning,<br />
going beyond traditional classroom teaching and<br />
taking within its ambit training in sports:<br />
[CIT vs. Secretary, Regional Committee, National<br />
Sports Club of Assam [1989] 180 ITR 648 (Gauhati) is<br />
squarely applicable:<br />
“To satisfy us in this regard, we have been taken through<br />
the order of the Tribunal passed in ITA Nos. 684 (Gauhati)<br />
to 689 (Gauhati) of 1973-74 which related to the same<br />
assessee. A perusal of that judgment shows that after<br />
going through the aims and objects of the assessee, it was<br />
held that the main object of the assessee is to<br />
provide means for improving the health and<br />
physique of the youth of Assam through the medium<br />
of sports and games of all kinds. The learned<br />
Tribunal, therefore, concluded that, in its considered<br />
opinion, the main object of the institution falls<br />
Page 95 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
within the head &#8220;Education&#8221;. In this context, our<br />
attention has been invited by Shri Bhattacharjee to Addl.<br />
CIT v. Surat Art Silk Cloth Manufacturers Association [1980]<br />
121 ITR 1 (SC) in which it has been held that if the primary<br />
or dominant purpose of a trust or institution is charitable,<br />
the subsidiary object would not militate against its<br />
charitable character and the purpose of the assessee would<br />
not be any the less charitable. It thus seems that, to<br />
decide whether the purpose of an assessee is<br />
charitable or not within the meaning of section 2(15)<br />
of the Act, attention has to be paid to the dominant<br />
or primary purpose of the assessee. As, in this case,<br />
it has been held by the learned Tribunal in its earlier<br />
judgment which was followed in the present case<br />
that the main object of the assessee falls within the<br />
head &#8220;Education&#8221;, it has to be accepted that the<br />
purpose of the assessee is charitable.<br />
Shri Choudhury, however, contends that the assessee is<br />
also carrying on an activity for profit by running a guesthouse.<br />
As to this, it has been brought to our notice by Shri<br />
Bhattacharjee that the words &#8220;not involving the carrying on<br />
of any activity for profit&#8221; which found place in section 2(15)<br />
of the Act at the relevant time are relatable to the last head<br />
of charitable purpose of which mention has been made in<br />
the section. We may note section 2(15) which at the<br />
relevant time read as below:<br />
&#8221; &#8216;Charitable purpose&#8217; includes relief of the poor, education,<br />
medical relief and the advancement of any other object of<br />
general public utility not involving the carrying on of any<br />
activity for profit.&#8221;<br />
It has been held in Surat Art Silk&#8217;s case [1980] 121 ITR 1<br />
(SC) that the words &#8220;not involving the carrying on of<br />
any activity for profit&#8221; qualify or govern only the last<br />
head of charitable purpose and not the earlier three<br />
ones. It was, therefore, held that if the purpose of a<br />
trust or institution be relief of the poor, education or<br />
medical relief, the requirement of the definition of<br />
&#8220;charitable purpose&#8221; would be fully satisfied, even if<br />
an activity for profit is carried on in the course of<br />
the actual carrying out of the primary purpose of the<br />
trust or institution.<br />
Page 96 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
This being the settled law by now and the finding of<br />
the learned Tribunal being that the main object of<br />
the institution falls within the head &#8220;Education&#8221;, and<br />
the primary purpose being the criterion for deciding<br />
whether the income has been earned for a charitable<br />
purpose, it has to be held that the questions of law<br />
involved in the present case are concluded by a<br />
judgment of the highest court of the land. In such a<br />
situation, any direction to make a reference would be<br />
academic and the High Court would be right in refusing the<br />
same as stated in Mathura Prasad v. CIT [1966] 60 ITR 428<br />
(SC).”<br />

[It has been held in Gujarat State Co-Operative Union<br />
vs. CIT [1992] 195 ITR 279 (Gujarat) with reference to<br />
the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Sole Trustee,<br />
Loka Shikshana Trust v. CIT [1975] 101 ITR 234 that the<br />
meaning of “education” is not to be narrowly construed:<br />
“The observations of the Supreme Court only indicate the<br />
proper confines of the word &#8220;education&#8221; in the context of<br />
the provisions of section 2(15) of the Act. It will not be<br />
proper to construe these observations in a manner in which<br />
they are construed by the Tribunal when it infers from<br />
these observations, in para 17 of its judgment, that the<br />
word &#8220;education&#8221; is limited to schools, colleges and similar<br />
institutions and does not extend to any other media for<br />
such acquisition of knowledge. The observations of the<br />
Supreme Court do not confine the word &#8220;education&#8221;<br />
only to scholastic instructions but other forms of<br />
education also are included in the word &#8220;education&#8221;.<br />
As noticed above, the word &#8220;schooling&#8221; also means<br />
instructing or educating. It, therefore, cannot be said that<br />
the word &#8220;education&#8221; has been given an unduly restricted<br />
meaning by the Supreme Court in the said decision.<br />
Though, in the context of the provision of section 10(22),<br />
the concept of education need not be given any wide or<br />
extended meaning, it surely would encompass<br />
systematic dissemination of knowledge and training<br />
in specialised subjects as is done by the assessee.<br />
The changing times and the ever widening horizons of<br />
knowledge may bring in changes in the methodology of<br />
teaching and a shift for the better in the institutional setup.<br />
Advancement of knowledge brings within its fold<br />

suitable methods of its dissemination and though<br />
the primary method of sitting in a classroom may<br />
remain ideal for most of the initial education, it may<br />
become necessary to have a different outlook for<br />
further education. It is not necessary to nail down<br />
the concept of education to a particular formula or<br />
to flow it only through a defined channel. Its<br />
progress lies in the acceptance of new ideas and<br />
development of appropriate means to reach them to<br />
the recipients.”<br />

Page 98 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
In light of these decisions, it is submitted that since the<br />
objects of the Respondent include promoting the game of<br />
cricket, imparting physical education through the medium<br />
of cricket and maintaining a library and periodicals on<br />
sports and cricket, Respondent’s activities pertain to<br />
“education” and hence fall under “charitable purpose”<br />
under Section 2(15) of the Act. The relevant objects are<br />
as follows (pgs.57-58 of Paper book for AY 2012-13):<br />
3.(e) To promote the game throughout Saurashtra and<br />
Kutch by organising coaching schemes, Tournaments,<br />
Exhibition Matches and by any other manner.<br />
3. (f) To foster the spirit of sportsmanship and the ideals of<br />
cricket amongst School, College and University students<br />
and others and educate them for the same.<br />
3. (l) To impart physical education through the medium of<br />
cricket and take all steps to assist the citizens to develop<br />
their physique.<br />
3. (p) To start and maintain a library of books, periodicals<br />
and museum on Sports in general and cricket in particular<br />
and to start journal or journals in cricket.<br />
Respondent has incurred expenses to hold various<br />
tournaments including the Inter District tournaments for<br />
the various age groups, Women’s matches and various<br />
Trophy tournaments which squarely fall under the<br />
educational activity. The Details of Tournament<br />
Expenses are on pg.12 of the Paperbook for the<br />
Assessment Year 2012-13. Further details of such<br />
Tournament Expenses were submitted to the Assessing<br />
Officer vide letter dated 07.03.2015. Copy of the same is at<br />
pgs.72-76 and details are on pgs. 77-144 of the<br />
Paperbook for Assessment Year 2012-13.<br />
II Alternatively and without prejudice, the<br />
activities carried out by the Respondent-Trust are<br />
charitable in nature, being “general public utility”<br />
and not in the nature of trade, commerce or<br />
business in view of amended provisions of Section<br />
2(15) of the Act :<br />
Page 99 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
· It has been observed by the lower authorities that the<br />
Respondent – Trust has arranged one day international<br />
matches of cricket and in turn has received TV subsidy /<br />
subvention income i.e sharing of TV broadcasting right<br />
income from BCCI and Advertisement sales income, and<br />
therefore, such activities are in the nature of trade,<br />
commerce or business in view of first proviso to S.2(15).<br />
· These observations by the lower authorities, as discussed<br />
by the ITAT on pages 453-454, are factually incorrect in as<br />
much as arranging of one day international matches of<br />
cricket, sale and auction of TV broadcasting rights and<br />
Advertisement sales income from holding one day<br />
internationals are all carried out by BCCI and not by the<br />
Respondent Cricket Association.<br />
· The question then for the kind consideration of this Court<br />
would be whether the activities of the Respondent Cricket<br />
Association can be held to be charitable within the meaning<br />
of S.2(15) so as to entitle it to claim exemption u/s 11 of<br />
the Act.<br />
· The entire issue has to be seen from the two limbs of<br />
the provisions of Section 2(15) of the Act viz.:<br />
(a) whether the promotion of sports and games, cricket in<br />
the present case is charitable or not within the definition<br />
as provided u/s 2(15) of the Act and<br />
(b) whether such promotion of sports and games of<br />
cricket are carried out with the profit – motive or not so<br />
to be treated as in the nature of trade, commerce or<br />
business or charitable purpose.<br />
Promotion of cricket is an advancement of “general<br />
public utility” and is hence a “charitable purpose” :<br />
· Insofar as the first limb as mentioned in (a) above is<br />
concerned, attention is invited to the Circular : No. 395 [F.<br />
No. 181(5) 82/IT(A-I)], dated 24-9-1984, wherein the Board<br />
has advised that promotion of sports and games is<br />
considered to be a charitable purpose within the meaning<br />
of section 2(15).<br />
Page 100 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
It is not in dispute that the Respondent is involved only in<br />
the activity of promoting the game of cricket. The<br />
Assessing Officer himself has noted so in para 3.3 of the<br />
order on page 61 of Tax Appeal that “the assessee is<br />
admittedly involved in promotion of cricket as a game.”<br />
Further, all of the objects of the assessee are related to<br />
promotion of cricket.<br />
Moreover, the Circular has also been held to be applicable<br />
by the lower authorities (Assessment Order on pg.3 and<br />
CIT(A) on pg.210-211 of Tax Appeal)<br />
· It is submitted that all the expenses of the Respondent<br />
have been incurred towards the object clause i.e.,<br />
promotion of cricket:<br />
The Expenses are as follows (pg.3 of Paperbook for<br />
Assessment Year 2012-13):<br />
Establishment Expenses : pg.11<br />
Stadium Expenses : pg.12<br />
Tournament Expenses : pg.12<br />
Depreciation : pg.9<br />
Cricket Infrastructure Fund* : pg.4, Resolution is<br />
on pg.21<br />
* Accumulation (pgs.20-21 of Paperbook for AY 2012-<br />
13)<br />
· Even from the Computation of Income on pg.15 of<br />
Paperbook for AY 2012-13, it can be seen that none of the<br />
expenses have been incurred for non-trust purposes.<br />
· Moreover, details and evidences of all the various<br />
incomes and expenses related to the objects of the<br />
Respondent have been submitted to the Assessing Officer<br />
vide letter dated 07.03.2015, reproduced on pgs. 72<br />
to160 of Paperbook for AY 2012-13.<br />
· Even after perusal of the same, it is not the case of the<br />
lower authorities that the Respondent has conducted<br />
activities or incurred expenses outside of the objects of the<br />
Respondent.<br />
Page 101 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
· Even the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal has held that the<br />
Commissioner has not been able to point out a<br />
single object of the Respondent which is in the<br />
nature of trade, commerce or business and that it is<br />
not even in dispute that the objects are “objects of general<br />
public utility.” All objects unambiguously promote cricket.<br />
(ITAT Order para 35., pg.456 of Tax Appeal)<br />
Hence, the activity of the Respondent is a charitable<br />
activity.<br />
Once it is established that the objects of the trust<br />
are of “general public utility” and that no activities<br />
deviating from the objects have been carried out,<br />
mere generation of surplus cannot turn it into an<br />
activity in the nature of trade, commerce or<br />
business.<br />
· Now so far as the second limb i.e first proviso to S.2(15)<br />
of the Act as inserted by the Finance Act, 2008 w.e.f<br />
01/04/2009 is concerned, it is submitted that the law is<br />
settled by the larger bench of Supreme Court in the case of<br />
ACIT vs. Surat Art Silk Cloth Manufacturers<br />
Association reported in 121 ITR 1 (SC) that (a) the<br />
primary or dominant purpose of the trust or institution has<br />
to be examined to determine whether the said trust /<br />
institution is involved in carrying out any activity for profit<br />
and (b) if the “object” of the trust or institution is to carry<br />
out object of general public utility and this is the primary or<br />
dominant purpose and not carrying on any activity for<br />
profit, the same would satisfy the requirements of S.2(15)<br />
of the Act.<br />
· Since the terms trade, commerce or business is not<br />
defined under the scheme of the Act, general or dictionary<br />
meaning has to be resorted to. In order to determine<br />
whether an activity is in the nature of trade, commerce or<br />
business OR charitable, the determining factor is profit<br />
motive. The nature of activities may remain the same.<br />
However, if they are carried out for profit motive, the same<br />
are to be characterized as trade, commerce or business.<br />
Conversely, if the profit motive is absent, these very<br />
activities become charitable.<br />
Page 102 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
· It is further submitted that (a) first proviso to S.2(15) of<br />
the act should not be generalized to each and every facts<br />
of the case where there is a surplus over the expenditure in<br />
respect of the activities or objects carried out by the Trust<br />
which are in any case of the charitable purpose, (b) the<br />
cardinal principle is the predominant object of the Trust. If<br />
the predominant object of the Trust is of charitable nature<br />
and with no-profit motive, the said activities cannot be<br />
treated as trade, commerce or business merely because<br />
some surplus has remained left over the expenditure to<br />
carry out such activities. The essence of trade, commerce<br />
or business is profit motive and absence thereof makes<br />
such activities charitable.<br />
· It is further submitted that even after insertion of proviso<br />
to S.2(15) of the Act wef 01/04/2009, the following<br />
authorities, after following the law laid down by Apex Court<br />
in Surat Art Silk (supra), have taken a view that if the<br />
predominant object of the Trust is of charitable nature and<br />
with no-profit motive, the said activities cannot be treated<br />
as trade, commerce or business merely because some<br />
surplus has remained left over the expenditure to carry out<br />
such activities :<br />
(a) CIT v. Gujarat industrial Development<br />
Corporation [2017] 83 taxmann.com 366<br />
(Gujarat)<br />
Where collection of fees and cess was incidental to the<br />
main charitable object of the trust, it would not fall under<br />
the second part of the proviso to Section 2(15) of the Act.<br />
(b) Sabarmati Ashram Gaushala Trust vs. ADIT<br />
(Exemption) [2014] 362 ITR 539 (Gujarat)<br />
“12. All these were the objects of the general public<br />
utility and would squarely fall under section 2 (15) of the<br />
Act. Profit making was neither the aim nor object of the<br />
Trust. It was not the principal activity. Merely because<br />
while carrying out the activities for the purpose of<br />
achieving the objects of the Trust, certain incidental<br />
surpluses were generated, would not render the<br />
activity in the nature of trade, commerce or<br />
business. As clarified by the CBDT in its Circular No.<br />
11/2008 dated 19th December 2008 the proviso aims to<br />
Page 103 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
attract those activities which are truly in the nature of<br />
trade, commerce or business but are carried out under the<br />
guise of activities in the nature of &#8216; public utility&#8217;.”<br />

Merely because under the statutory provisions and to meet<br />
with the expenditure of Town Planning Scheme and/or<br />

Scheme, such as road, drainage, electricity, water supply<br />
etc. if the assessee is permitted to sale the plots (land) to<br />
the extent of 15% of the total area under the Town<br />
Planning Scheme and while selling the said plots they are<br />
sold by holding the public auction, it cannot be said that<br />

15. Now, so far as another question which is posed for the<br />
consideration of this Court i.e. whether while collecting the<br />
cess or fees, activities of the assessee can be said to be<br />
rendering any services in relation to any trade, commerce<br />
or business is concerned, for the reasons stated above,<br />
merely because the assessee is collecting cess or fees<br />
which is regulatory in nature, the proviso to Section 2(15)of<br />
the Act shall not be applicable. As observed herein above<br />
neither there is element of profiteering nor the same can<br />
be said to be in the nature of trade, commerce or<br />
business.”<br />

DGIT reported in 347 ITR 99 (Delhi)<br />
The Hon’ble High Court held that the fundamental or<br />
dominant function of the Institute was to exercise overall<br />
control and regulate the activities of the members/enrolled<br />
chartered accountants and merely because the Institute<br />
Page 104 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
was holding coaching classes which also generate income,<br />
the Court held that proviso to Section 2 (15) of the Act<br />
would not be applicable<br />
In the present case, the main object of the Trust is to<br />
promote and encourage the game of cricket in Saurashtra<br />
and Kutch by organizing coaching schemes, tournaments,<br />
exhibition matches and other matches etc. The attention is<br />
further invited to the clause 3(j) of MOA which provides<br />
“to organize matches for the achievements of the objects<br />
of the Association and utilize the net proceeds thereof<br />
towards the implementation of the object set therein”. It is<br />
submitted that all the receipts arising or accruing to<br />
the Respondent-Trust are on account of the<br />
activities carried out to meet the object of the<br />
Respondent i.e to promote and encourage the game of<br />
cricket in Saurashtra and Kutch by organizing coaching<br />
schemes, tournaments, exhibition matches and other<br />
matches etc, and they are not with the intention to carry<br />
out any trade, commerce or business with profit – motive.<br />
Such receipts should be strictly confined to the attainment<br />
of the objects of the Respondent-Trust and with the<br />
intention to carry out any trade, commerce or business.<br />
Details of all the receipts were submitted to the<br />
Assessing Officer, as reproduced in the Assessment<br />
Order on pgs. 4 to 9 of Tax Appeal. As can be seen<br />
from the nature of the receipts, none of the incomes<br />
pertain to any activity other than promoting the game of<br />
cricket.<br />
It is submitted that promotion of sports is itself not an<br />
activity in the nature of trade, commerce or business and<br />
on that count also the proviso is not applicable. The<br />
Hon’ble High Court of Bombay in CIT (Exemptions) vs.<br />
Bombay Presidency Golf Club Ltd. [2019] 106<br />
taxmann.com 58 (Bombay) has held that:<br />
“In the present case, the main object of the assessee club<br />
as noted above is to provide golf facilities to the<br />
members for promotion of the sport. The Tribunal<br />
correctly held that there was no element of the<br />
assessee&#8217;s activity being in the nature of trade,<br />
commerce or business. Once the applicability of the<br />
Page 105 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
proviso to Section 2(15) of the Act is ruled out, the question<br />
of the exemption under Section 11 of the Act would arise.”<br />
(Emphasis supplied)<br />
Further reliance is also placed on the Supreme Court<br />
decision in the case of CIT vs. Gujarat Maritime Board<br />
reported in [2007] 295 ITR 561(SC), wherein the<br />
question before the Apex Court was that whether the<br />
Maritime Board was entitled to the status of a charitable<br />
institution u/s 11 of the Act and in that context also, the<br />
Apex Court observed that the Gujarat Maritime Board was<br />
established for the predominant purpose of development of<br />
minor ports within the State of Gujarat, the management<br />
and control of Board was essentially with the State<br />
Government and there was no profit motive and the<br />
income including reserves and surplus earned by the Board<br />
was deployed for the development of minor ports in the<br />
State of Gujarat and accordingly the Apex Court held that<br />
the Board was entitled to be registered as “Charitable<br />
Trust” within the scheme of the Act<br />
It is submitted that the insertion of proviso to s.<br />
2(15) does not mean that in case an assessee is to<br />
receive any payment for anything done for trade,<br />
commerce or business, the assessee will be hit by<br />
the said proviso. Elaborating the scope of this<br />
amendment, CBDT, vide Circular No. 11, dt. 19th Dec.,<br />
2008 [(2009) 221 CTR (St) 1], has observed as follows:<br />
&#8220;3. The newly amended s. 2(15) will apply only to the<br />
entities whose purpose is &#8216;advancement of any other object<br />
of general public utility&#8217; i.e., the fourth limb of definition of<br />
&#8216;charitable purpose&#8217; contained in s. 2(15). Hence, such<br />
entities will not be eligible for exemption under s. 11 or<br />
under s. 10(23C) of the Act, if they carry on commercial<br />
activities. Whether such an entity is carrying on an activity<br />
in the nature of trade, commerce or business is a question<br />
of fact which will be decided based on the nature, scope,<br />
extent and frequency of activity.”<br />
As long as the object of general public utility is not merely<br />
a mask to hide true purpose or rendering of any service in<br />
relation thereto, and where such services are being<br />
rendered as purely incidental to or as subservient to the<br />
Page 106 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
main objective of &#8216;general public utility&#8217;, the carrying on of<br />
bonafide activities in furtherance of such objectives of<br />
&#8216;general public utility&#8217; cannot be hit by the proviso to<br />
Section 2(15).<br />
Respondent also draws support from Circular no.194/16-<br />
17 II(AI) in which the question referred to board is;<br />
whether an educational institution existing solely for<br />
educational purpose but which shows some surplus at the<br />
end of the year is eligible for exemption? The board had<br />
replied this question in the following manner:<br />
“If the profit of the educational institution can be diverted<br />
for the personal use of the proprietor thereof, then the<br />
income of the educational institution will be subject to tax.<br />
However, there may be cases where the educational<br />
institutions may be owned by the trusts or societies to<br />
whom the provisions of section 11 may be applicable.<br />
Where all the objects of these trusts are educational, and<br />
the surplus, if any, from running the educational institution<br />
is used for educational purposes only, it can be held that<br />
the institution is existing for educational purposes and not<br />
for purposes of profit. However, if the surplus can be used<br />
for non-educational purposes, it cannot be said that the<br />
institution is existing solely for educational purposes and<br />
such institutions will not be liable for exemption u/s 10(22).<br />
But, in such cases, the applicability of section 11 can be<br />
examined and if the conditions laid down therein are<br />
satisfied, the income will be exempt u/s 11.”<br />
The principle would also apply to the case of the<br />
Respondent.<br />
It is submitted that there are decisions of other<br />
Hon’ble High Courts that are in favour of the<br />
Respondent:<br />
· Tamil Nadu Cricket Association v. DIT (Exemptions)<br />
[2014] 360 ITR 633 (Mad)<br />
· CIT (Exemptions) v. Rajasthan Cricket Association<br />

adjudicating upon an appeal, where two views are<br />

possible, the view in favour of the assessee should<br />
be adopted. In the facts of the present case, there<br />
are large numbers of decisions which are in favour<br />
of the assessee and therefore, even if the view<br />
against the assessee is plausible and probable, the<br />
view in favour may kindly be adopted:<br />

(b) Orissa State Warehousing Corporation v CIT 237 ITR<br />

In addition to the above, it is submitted with respect to<br />
Question [C] that the Tribunal has remitted the issue of<br />
infrastructure subsidy to the file of the Assessing Officer. It<br />
is submitted that for this reason, no substantial question of<br />
law arises.”<br />
92. We propose to first deal with the submission of Mr. Bhatt,<br />
the learned senior counsel appearing for the Revenue that the<br />
matters deserve to be remitted to the ITAT for fresh<br />
consideration of the issues in question. This submission of Mr.<br />
Bhatt is canvassed in the wake of the fact that, according to<br />
Mr. Bhatt, the ITAT ought to have assigned cogent reasons in<br />
its impugned order for the purpose of disagreeing with the<br />
concurrent findings recorded by the lower revenue authorities,<br />
namely, the Assessing Officer and the CIT(A). We are not<br />
impressed by such submission of Mr. Bhatt. We are of the view<br />
that there is no good reason to remit the matters for fresh<br />
consideration. As discussed above, the only circumstance that<br />
Page 108 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
weighed with the CIT(A) is the revenue earned by the<br />
Associations through the subsidy paid by the BCCI. We have<br />
dealt with this issue at length while deciding the Tax Appeal<br />
No.268 of 2012. We take notice of the fact that the issue with<br />
regard to the Proviso to Section 2(15) of the Act has been<br />
elaborately dealt with by the ITAT in its own way. The ITAT has<br />
conveyed, in so many words, that for the purpose of invoking<br />
the Proviso to Section 2(15) of the Act, many other aspects<br />
need to be looked into and the subsidy paid by the BCCI<br />
cannot be the sole factor for brining the case within the Proviso<br />
to Section 2(15) of the Act.<br />
93. At the cost of repetition, we, once again, reproduce the<br />
findings recorded by the ITAT in this regard. We are<br />
highlighting the findings to demonstrate why the ITAT<br />
disagreed with the CIT(A) . The findings are as under;<br />
“34. What essentially follows from the above discussions<br />
is that, even after the 2008 amendment and insertion of<br />
proviso to Section 2(15), so far as ‘any other object of<br />
general public utility&#8217; is concerned, as long as profit<br />
earning is not the predominant purpose of the activity of<br />
the assessee, the benefit of Section 2(15) cannot be<br />
declined. In other words, the accrual of profits to the<br />
assessee, by itself, cannot, therefore, be reason enough<br />
to hold that the assessee is not covered by the definition<br />
of ‘charitable institution’ under section 2(15). Of course,<br />
all these discussions are relevant only for the residuary<br />
clause i.e. “any other object of general public utility”. In<br />
case, therefore, where the objects being pursued by the<br />
assessee is “relief of the poor”, “education” or “medical<br />
relief&#8221;, it is not even material whether or not the<br />
assessee is carrying on an activity in the nature of trade,<br />
commerce or business in the course of such activities.<br />
The key factor is as to what are the activities of the<br />
assessee institution and as to what these activities seek<br />
to achieve.<br />
Page 109 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
35. Let us take a pause here and examine as to what<br />
are the activities of the assessee cricket associations so<br />
as to be brought within the ambit of trade, commerce or<br />
business. We have seen objects of the association, which<br />
are reproduced earlier in our order, and it is not even the<br />
case of the revenue that these objects have anything to<br />
do with any trade, commerce or business; these objects<br />
are simply to promote cricket. The trigger for invoking<br />
proviso to Section 2(15), as Shri Soparkar rightly<br />
contends has to an activity of the assessee which is in<br />
the nature of trade, commerce or business. However, the<br />
case of the revenue authorities hinges on the allegation<br />
that the way and manner in which cricket matches are<br />
being organized, particularly the IPL matches, the activity<br />
of organizing cricket matches is nothing but brute<br />
commerce. Undoubtedly, it would appear that right from<br />
the time Kerry Packer started his World Series Cricket in<br />
1977, there has been no looking back in<br />
commercialization of cricket and the impact of this<br />
commercialization has not left Indian cricket intact. The<br />
Indian Premier League and the rules of the game being<br />
governed by the dictates of commercial considerations<br />
may seem to be one such example of commercialization<br />
of Indian cricket. The difficulty for the case of the<br />
revenue before us, however, is that these matches are<br />
not being organized by the local cricket associations. We<br />
are told that the matches are being organized by the<br />
Board of Cricket Control of India, but then, if we are to<br />
accept this claim and invoke the proviso to Section 2(15)<br />
for this reason, it will amount to a situation in which<br />
proviso to Section 2(15) is being invoked on account of<br />
activities of an entity other than the assesseessomething<br />
which law does not permit. We are not really<br />
concerned, at this stage, whether the allegations about<br />
commercialization of cricket by the BCCI are correct or<br />
not, because that aspect of the matter would be relevant<br />
only for the purpose of proviso to Section 2(15) being<br />
invoked in the hands of the BCCI. We do not wish to deal<br />
with that aspect of the matter or to make any<br />
observations which would prejudge the case of the BCCI.<br />
Suffice to say that the very foundation of revenue’s case<br />
is devoid of legally sustainable basis for the short reason<br />
that the commercialization of cricket by the BCCI, even if<br />
that be so, cannot be reason enough to invoke the<br />
proviso to Section 2(15). We are alive of the learned<br />
Commissioner (DR)’s suggestion that the cricket<br />
Page 110 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
associations cannot be seen on standalone basis as the<br />
BCCI is nothing but an apex body of these cricket<br />
associations at a collective level and whatever BCCI does<br />
is at the behest of or with the connivance of the local<br />
cricket associations, and that it is not the case that<br />
anyone can become a Member of the BCCI because only<br />
a recognized cricket association can become a Member<br />
of the BCCI. We are also alive to learned Commissioner’s<br />
argument that what is being sought to be protected by<br />
the Charitable status of these associations is the share of<br />
these cricket associations from the commercial profits<br />
earned by the BCCI by organizing the cricket matches.<br />
The problem, however, is that the activities of the apex<br />
body; as we have explained earlier, cannot be reason<br />
enough to trigger proviso to Section 2(15) in these cases.<br />
Whether these cricket associations collectively constitute<br />
BCCI or not, in the event of BCCI being involved in<br />
commercial activities, the taxability of such commercial<br />
profits will arise in the hands of the BCCI and not the end<br />
beneficiaries. Even in such a case the point of taxability<br />
of these profits is the BCCI and not the cricket<br />
associations, because, even going by learned<br />
Commissioner’s arguments, these receipts in the hands<br />
of the cricket associations is nothing but appropriation of<br />
profits. What can be taxed is accrual of profits and not<br />
appropriation of profits. In any event, distinction between<br />
the cricket associations and the BCCI cannot be ignored<br />
for the purposes of tax treatment. There is no dispute<br />
that the matches were organized by the BCCI, and the<br />
assessee cannot thus be faulted for the commercial<br />
considerations said to be inherent in planning the<br />
matches. As we make these observations, and as we do<br />
not have the benefit of hearing the perspective of the<br />
BCCI, we make it clear that these observations will have<br />
no bearing on any adjudication in the hands of the BCCI.<br />
Suffice to say that so far as the cricket associations are<br />
concerned, the allegations of the revenue authorities<br />
have no bearing on the denial of the status of ‘charitable<br />
activities’ in the hands of the cricket associations before<br />
us- particularly as learned Commissioner has not been<br />
able to point out a single object of the assessee cricket<br />
associations which is in the nature of trade, commerce or<br />
business, and, as it is not even in dispute that the objects<br />
being pursued by the assessee cricket associations are<br />
“objects of general public utility”under section 2(15). All<br />
the objects of the assessee cricket associations, as<br />
Page 111 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
reproduced earlier in this order, unambiguously seek to<br />
promote the cricket, and this object, as has been all<br />
along accepted by the CBDT itself, an object of general<br />
public utility.<br />
36. Cricket is indeed an immensely popular game in<br />
this part of the world, and anything to do with cricket<br />
results in mass involvement of public at large. The sheer<br />
strength of these numbers results in higher visibility of<br />
cricketing activities and the scale of operations on which<br />
the work for development of cricket is to be carried out.<br />
These facts, by itself, and without the assessees before<br />
us deviating from their objects or venturing into trade,<br />
commerce or business, cannot require the activities to be<br />
treated as commercial activities. When a cricket stadium<br />
is to be built, it has to accommodate a very large number<br />
of persons but the size of the stadium would not mean<br />
that the activity is for anything other than promotion of<br />
cricket.. When the numbers are large, the scale of<br />
operations is large, and when scale of operations are<br />
larger, even the surplus or deficit could be large, but then<br />
the scale of operations may be a scale on which<br />
commercial activities could be carried out but that fact<br />
cannot convert an object of general public utility into a<br />
commercial activity. We have carefully analyzed the<br />
annual reports and the annual financial<br />
statements of the assessee, and we do not find<br />
any objects, other than objects of the cricket<br />
associations, being pursed by these cricket<br />
associations. The objects of these cricket<br />
associations clearly demonstrate that these cricket<br />
associations exist and operate purely for the<br />
purpose of promoting cricket. We are, therefore,<br />
of the considered view that the proviso to Section<br />
2(15) has been wrongly invoked in these cases.”<br />
94. From the above, it is evident that the ITAT considered the<br />
issue bearing in mind the activities of the assessee and what<br />
such activities seek to achieve. The ITAT has observed that it<br />
carefully analyzed the annual reports and the annual financial<br />
statements of the assessee, and upon perusal of the same, the<br />
ITAT reached to the conclusion that the activities undertaken<br />
by the Associations were not contrary to the objects. This is a<br />
Page 112 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
pure finding on a question of fact. In such circumstance,<br />
referred to above, it cannot be said or argued that the ITAT<br />
passed the impugned order in a very slipshod manner or<br />
without assigning any cogent reasons.<br />
95. We shall now proceed to examine the main issue on our<br />
own.<br />
96. Section 2(15) of the Act defines the term “Charitable<br />
Purpose”. The definition reads as under:<br />
&#8216;Section 2(15):-&#8220;charitable purpose&#8221; includes relief of the<br />
poor, education, yoga, medical relief, preservation of<br />
environment (including watersheds, forests and wildlife)<br />
and preservation of monuments or places or objects of<br />
artistic or historic interest, and the advancement of any<br />
other object of general public utility:<br />
Provided that the advancement of any other object of<br />
general public utility shall not be a charitable purpose, if<br />
it involves the carrying on of any activity in the nature of<br />
trade, commerce or business, or any activity of rendering<br />
any service in relation to any trade, commerce or<br />
business, for a cess or fee or any other consideration,<br />
irrespective of the nature of use or application, or<br />
retention, of the income from such activity, unless—<br />
(i) such activity is undertaken in the course of actual<br />
carrying out of such advancement of any other object of<br />
general public utility; and<br />
(ii) the aggregate receipts from such activity or activities<br />
during the previous year, do not exceed twenty per cent<br />
of the total receipts, of the trust or institution<br />
undertaking such activity or activities, of that previous<br />
year;”<br />
97. S.2(15) of the 1961 Act::-<br />
Charitable purpose, defined (upto 31-3-2009).-<br />
According to section 2(15), the expression “charitable<br />
purpose” has been defined by way of an inclusive definition so<br />
Page 113 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
as to include-<br />
-relief to the poor,<br />
-education,<br />
-medical relief, and<br />
-the advancement of any other object of general public utility<br />
[(upto 31-3-1984) not involving the carrying on of any activity<br />
for profit].<br />
98. The subject-matter of this definition has been dealt with<br />
under section 11, post.<br />
99. Charitable purpose, defined (operative from 1-4-<br />
2009).-As per section 2(15), newly substituted (w.e.f. 1-4-<br />
2009) by the Finance Act, 2008, the expression “charitable<br />
purpose” has been defined by way of an inclusive definition so<br />
as to include;<br />
-relief to the poor,<br />
-education,<br />
medical relief,<br />
-(w.e.f. 1-4-2009) preservation of environment (including<br />
watersheds, forests and Wildlife) and Preservation of<br />
monuments or places or objects of artistic of historic interest<br />
and,<br />
-the advancement of any other object of general public utility.<br />
100. The first proviso to section 2(15) provides that the<br />
advancement of any other object of general public utility shall<br />
not be a charitable purpose, if it involves the carrying on of<br />
any activity:<br />
&#8211; in the nature of trade, commerce or business, or<br />
Page 114 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
-of rendering any service in relation to any trade, commerce or<br />
business, for a cess or fee or any other consideration,<br />
irrespective of the nature of use or application, or retention, of<br />
the income from such activity.<br />
101. The second proviso to section 2(15) as newly inserted<br />
(w..e.f. 1-4-2009) by the Finance Act, 2010, further provides<br />
that the first proviso shall not apply if the aggregate value of<br />
the receipts from the activities referred to therein is<br />
-(between 1-4-2009 and 31-3-2012) Rs. 10 lakhs<br />
-(w.e.f. 1-4-2012) Rs. 25 lakhs<br />
or less in the previous year.<br />
102. Legislative amendments.-<br />
I. The Finance Act, 1983-By section 3(a) of Act 11 of 1983,<br />
section 2(15) has been amended (w.e.f. 1-4-1984).<br />
II The Finance Act, 2008.-The scope and effect of the<br />
substitution (w.e.f. 1-4-2009) of section 2(15) by Act 18 of<br />
2008, have been elaborated in the following portion of the<br />
departmental circular No. 1/2009, dated 27-3-2009, as under:-<br />
&#8216;Streamlining the definition of “charitable purpose”.-<br />
5.1 Sub-section (15) of section 2 of the Act defines<br />
“charitable purpose” to include relief of the poor,<br />
education, medical relief, and the advancement of any<br />
other object of general public utility. It has been noticed<br />
that a number of entities operating on commercial lines<br />
are claiming exemption on their income either under subsection<br />
(23C) of section 10 or section 11 of the Act on<br />
the ground that they are charitable institutions. This is<br />
based on the argument that they are engaged in the<br />
“advancement of an object of general public utility” as is<br />
included in the fourth limb of the current definition of<br />
“charitable purpose” Such as claim, when made in<br />
Page 115 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
respect of an activity carried out on commercial lines, is<br />
is contrary to the intention of the provision.<br />
5.2 With a view to limiting the scope of the phrase<br />
“advancement of any other object of general public<br />
utility”, sub-section (15) of section 2 has been amended<br />
to provide that the advancement of any other object of<br />
general public utility shall not be a charitable purpose, if<br />
it involves the carrying on of any activity in the nature of<br />
trade commerce or business, or any activity of rendering<br />
any service in relation to any trade, commerce or<br />
business, for a cess or fee or any other consideration,<br />
irrespective of the nature of use or application, or<br />
retention, of the income from such activity. Scope of this<br />
amendment has further been explained by the CBDT vide<br />
its Circular 11/2008 dated December 19, 2008.<br />
5.3 Applicability: This amendment has been made<br />
applicable with effect from 1st April, 2009, and shall<br />
accordingly apply for the assessment year 2009-10 and<br />
subsequent assessment years.’.<br />
III The Finance (No.2) Act, 2009-The scope and effect of the<br />
substitution (w..e.f. 1-4-2009) of section 2(15) by Act 33 of<br />
2009 have been elaborated in the following portion of the<br />
departmental circular No.5/2010, dated 3-6-2010, as under:-<br />
“Amendment to include certain activities within the ambit<br />
of provisions relating to “charitable purpose” in the<br />
Income-tax Act.<br />
4.1 For the purposes of the Income-tax Act, “charitable<br />
purpose” has been defined in section 2(15) of the<br />
Income-tax Act and it includes<br />
(a) relief to the poor,<br />
(b) education,<br />
(c) medical relief and,<br />
(d) the advancement of any other object of general public<br />
utility.<br />
However, as per proviso to the section, the<br />
“advancement of any other object of general public<br />
utility” shall not be a charitable purpose, if it involves the<br />

for a cess or fee or any other consideration, irrespective<br />
of the nature of use or application, or retention, of the<br />
income from such activity.<br />
4.2 Clause (15) of section 2 has been amended so as to<br />
provide that the preservation of environment (including<br />
watersheds, forests and wildlife) and preservation of<br />
monuments or places or objects of artistic or historic<br />
interest would be excluded from the applicability of the<br />
aforesaid proviso which is applicable to the<br />

IV The Finance Act, 2010:&#8211;The scope and effect of the<br />
insertion (w.e.f. 1-4-2009) of a new second proviso in section<br />
2(15) have been elaborated in the following portion of the<br />
departmental circular No.1/2011, dated 6-4~2011, as under:<br />
‘Change in the definition of “charitable purpose”.-<br />
4.1 For the purposes of the Income-tax Act, “charitable<br />
purpose” has been defined in section 2(15) which, among<br />
others, includes “the advancement of any other object of<br />
general public utility”.<br />
4.2 However, “the advancement of any other object of<br />
general public utility” is not a charitable purpose, if it<br />
involves the carrying on of any activity in the nature of<br />
trade, commerce or business, or any activity of rendering<br />

commercial nature may create hardship to the<br />

organizations which receive sundry considerations from<br />
such activities. Therefore, section 2(15) has been<br />
amended to provide that “the advancement of any other<br />
object of general public utility” shall continue to be a<br />
“charitable purpose” if the total receipts from any activity<br />
in the nature of trade, commerce or business, or any<br />
activity of rendering any service in relation to any trade,<br />
commerce or business do not exceed Rs.10 lakhs in the<br />
previous year.<br />
4.4 Applicability: This amendment has been made<br />
effective retrospectively from 1st April, 2009 and will,<br />
accordingly, apply in relation to the assessment year<br />
2009-10 and subsequent years.’.<br />
V. The Finance Act, 2011.-The second proviso to section<br />
2(15) has been amended (w.e.f. 1-4-2012) by section 3 of Act 8<br />
of 2011.<br />
The scope and effect of the amendment made in section<br />
2(15) by the Finance Act, 2011 have been elaborated in the<br />
following portion of the departmental circular No.2 of of 2012<br />
dated 22-05-012. as follows:<br />
Definition of “charitable purpose&#8221;:-<br />
4.1 For the purpose of the 1961 Act, “charitable<br />
purpose“ has been determined in section 2(15) which,<br />
among others, include &#8220;the advancement of any other<br />
object of general public utility”.<br />
4.2 However. “the advancement of any other object of<br />
general public utility” is not considered as a charitable<br />
purpose. if it involves the carrying on of any activity in<br />
the nature of trade. commerce or business. or any<br />
activity of rendering any service in relation to any trade.<br />
commerce or business, for a cess or fee or any other<br />
consideration, irrespective of the nature of use or<br />
application, or retention, of the income from such<br />
activity. if receipts from such activities is above the<br />
specified limit in the previous year.<br />

C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
4.3 Second proviso to section 2(15) of the 1961 Act has<br />
been amended to provide that the specified monetary<br />
limit in respect of receipts from such activities shall be 25<br />
lakh rupees instead of 10 lakh rupees.<br />
4.4 Applicability.&#8211;This amendment has been made<br />
effective from [1st April. 20l2, and will, accordingly, apply<br />
in relation to the assessment year 2012-13 and<br />
subsequent years.”<br />
Departmental circular.-1. Definition of “Charitable<br />
purpose” under section 2(15) of the Income-tax Act, 1961-reg-<br />
Section 2(15) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“the Act”), defines<br />
“charitable purpose” to include the following:<br />
(i) relief to the poor<br />
(ii) education<br />
(iii) medical relief, and<br />
(iv) the advancement of any other object of general public<br />
utility.<br />
An entity with a charitable object of the above nature was<br />
eligible for exemption from tax under section Section 11 or<br />
alternatively under section 10(23C) of the Act. However. it was<br />
seen that a number of entities who were engaged in<br />
commercial activities were also claiming exemption on the<br />
ground that such activities were for the advancement of<br />
objects of general public utility in terms of the fourth limb of<br />
the definition of “charitable purpose&#8221;. Therefore. section 2(15)<br />
was amended, vide Finance Act. 2008, by adding a proviso<br />
which states that the “advancement of any other object of<br />
general public utility” shall not be a charitable purpose if it<br />
involves the carrying on of &#8211;<br />
(a) any activity in the nature of trade, commerce or business:<br />
or<br />
(b) any activity of rendering any service in relation to any<br />
Page 119 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
trade. commerce or business;<br />
for a cess or fee or any other consideration, irrespective<br />
of the nature of use or application, or retention of the income<br />
from such activity.<br />
2. The following implications arise from this amendment –<br />
2.1 The newly inserted proviso to section 2(15) will not apply in<br />
respect of the first three limbs of section 2(15), i.e., relief of<br />
the poor, education or medical relief. Consequently, where the<br />
purpose of a trust or institution is relief of the poor, education<br />
or medical relief, it will constitute ‘charitable purpose’ even if it<br />
incidentally involves the carrying on of commercial activities.<br />
2.2. ‘Relief of the poor’ encompasses a wide range of objects<br />
for the welfare of the economically and socially disadvantaged<br />
or needy. It will, therefore, include within its ambit purposes<br />
such as relief to destitute, orphans or the handicapped,<br />
disadvantaged women or children, small and marginal farmers,<br />
indigent artisans or senior citizens in need of aid. Entities who<br />
have these objects will continue to be eligible for exemption<br />
even if they incidentally carry on a commercial activity,<br />
subject, however, to the conditions stipulated under section<br />
11(4A) or the seventh proviso to section 10(23C) which are<br />
that<br />
(i) the business should be incidental to the attainment of<br />
the objectives of the entity,and<br />
(ii) separate books of account should be maintained in<br />
respect of such business.<br />
Similarly, entities whose object is ‘education’ or ‘medical relief’<br />
would also continue to be eligible for exemption as charitable<br />
Page 120 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
institutions even if they incidentally carry on a commercial<br />
activity subject to the conditions mentioned above.<br />
3. The newly inserted proviso to section 2(15) will apply only to<br />
entities whose purpose is ‘advancement of any other object of<br />
general public utility’ i.e. the fourth limb of the definition of<br />
‘charitable purpose’ contained in section 2(15). Hence, such<br />
entities will not be eligible for exemption under section 11 or<br />
under section 10(23C) of the Act if they carry on commercial<br />
activities. Whether such an entity is carrying on an activity in<br />
the nature of trade, commerce or business is a question of fact<br />
which will be decided based on the nature, scope, extent and<br />
frequency of the activity.<br />
3.1. There are industry and trade associations who claim<br />
exemption from tax u/s 11 on the ground that their objects are<br />
for charitable purpose as these are covered under ‘any other<br />
object of general public utility’. Under the principle of<br />
mutuality, if trading takes place between persons who are<br />
associated together and contribute to a common fund for the<br />
financing of some venture or object and in this respect have no<br />
dealings or relations with any outside body, then any surplus<br />
returned to the persons forming such association is not<br />
chargeable to tax. In such cases, there must be complete<br />
identity between the contributors and the participants.<br />
Therefore, where industry or trade associations claim both to<br />
be charitable institutions as well as mutual organizations and<br />
their activities are restricted to contributions from and<br />
participation of only their members, these would not fall under<br />
the purview of the proviso to section 2(15) owing to the<br />
principle of mutuality. However, if such organizations have<br />
dealings with non-members, their claim to be charitable<br />
Page 121 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
organizations would now be governed by the additional<br />
conditions stipulated in the proviso to section 2 (15).<br />
3.2. In the final analysis, however, whether the assessee has<br />
for its object ‘the advancement of any other object of general<br />
public utility’ is a question of fact. If such assessee is engaged<br />
in any activity in the nature of trade, commerce or business or<br />
renders any service in relation to trade, commerce or business,<br />
it would not be entitled to claim that its object is charitable<br />
purpose. In such a case, the object of ‘general public utility’<br />
will be only a mask or a device to hide the true purpose which<br />
is trade, commerce or business or the rendering of any service<br />
in relation to trade, commerce or business. Each case would,<br />
therefore, be decided on its own facts and no generalization is<br />
possible. Assessees, who claim that their object is ‘charitable<br />
purpose’ within the meaning of Section 2(15), would be well<br />
advised to eschew any activity which is in the nature of trade,<br />
commerce or business or the rendering of any service in<br />
relation to any trade, commerce or business.<br />
103. In the course of the hearing of these appeals, our<br />
attention was drawn to the following extract from the speech<br />
of the Minister of Finance on 29th February, 2008.<br />
“ 180. Charitable purpose&#8217; includes ― relief of the poor,<br />
education, medical relief and any other object of general<br />
public utility. These activities are tax exempt, as they<br />
should be. However, some entities carrying on regular<br />
trade, commerce or business or providing services in<br />
relation to any trade commerce or business and earning<br />
income have sought to claim that their purpose would<br />
also fall under &#8216;charitable purpose&#8217;. Obviously, this way<br />
not the intention of Parliament and, hence, I propose to<br />
amend the law to exclude the aforesaid cases. Genuine<br />
charitable organizations will not in any way be affected.”<br />
Page 122 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
104. Our attention was also drawn to the following extract<br />
from the reply of the Finance Minister to the Debate in the Lok<br />
Sabha on the Finance Bill, 2008:-<br />
“ 6. Clause 3 of the Finance ― Bill, 2008 seeks to amend<br />
the definition of charitable purpose&#8217; so as to exclude any<br />
activity in the nature of trade, commerce or business, or<br />
any activity of rendering any service in relation to any<br />
trade, commerce or business, for a cess or fee or any<br />
other consideration, irrespective of the nature or use of<br />
application, or retention, of the income from such activity.<br />
The intention is to limit the benefit to entities which are<br />
engaged in activities such as relief of the poor, education,<br />
medical relief and any other genuine charitable purpose,<br />
and to deny it to purely commercial and business entities<br />
which wear the mask of a charity. A number of Honourable<br />
Members have written to me expressing their concern on<br />
the possible impact of the proposal on Agricultural<br />
Produce Market Committees (APMC) or State Agricultural<br />
Marketing Boards (SAMB). Since there is no intention to<br />
tax such committees or boards, and in order to remove<br />
any doubts, I propose to insert a new clause (26AAB) in<br />
section 10 of the Income tax Act to provide exemption to<br />
any income of an APMC or SAMB constituted under any<br />
law for the time being in force for the purpose of<br />
regulating the marketing of agricultural produce. I once<br />
again assure the House that genuine charitable<br />
organisations will not in any way be affected. The CBDT<br />
will, following the usual practice, issue an explanatory<br />
circular containing guidelines for determining whether an<br />
entity is carrying on any activity in the nature of trade,<br />
commerce or business or any activity of rendering any<br />
service in relation to any trade, commerce or business.<br />
Whether the purpose is a charitable purpose will depend<br />
on the totality of the facts of the case. Ordinarily,<br />
Chambers of Commerce and similar organisations<br />
rendering services to their members would not be affected<br />
by the amendment and their activities would continue to<br />
be regarded as ―advancement of any other object of<br />
general public utility. (underlining added) “<br />
105. Thus, prima facie, it appears from the above that the<br />
object of the introduction of the Proviso to clause (15) of<br />
Section 2 of the said Act was to deny the benefit of the Income<br />
Page 123 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
Tax Act exemption to purely commercial and business entities<br />
which wear the mask of a charity. The genuine charitable<br />
organizations were not affected in any way.<br />
106. The first and the foremost thing we want to clarify is that<br />
the registration of the assessee as a Charitable Institution<br />
would, prima facie, clothe the assesseee with the character of<br />
a charitable institution. However, the game, by itself, is not<br />
conclusive and the question whether the assessee is<br />
established for a charitable purpose or not must be examined<br />
independently with reference to the provisions of the Act. The<br />
registration of the assessee as a charitable institution under<br />
Section 12A of the Act, 1961 is a relevant factor in reaching an<br />
appropriate conclusion. Unless the positive requirements of<br />
law are satisfied, the assessee, only by virtue of the aforesaid<br />
event, cannot be regarded as a Charitable Institution. The<br />
objects, for which, the assessee is established either as a<br />
Society or as a Association should spell out any charitable<br />
purpose.<br />
107. In the aforesaid context, it may be pertinent to refer to<br />
the decision of this High Court in the case of Hiralal<br />
Bhagwati v. Commissioner of Income Tax, [2000] 161<br />
CTR (Guj) 401, wherein the Court has held as under:<br />
“The registration of a charitable trust under section 12A<br />
is not an empty formality. This is apparent from the tenor<br />
of the provisions of section 12A. It requires that not only<br />
an application should be filed in the prescribed form,<br />
setting the details of the origin of the trust, but also<br />
names and addresses of the trustees and/or managers<br />
should be furnished. The CIT has to examine the objects<br />
of creation as well as an empirical study of the past<br />
activities of the applicant. The CIT has to examine that it<br />
Page 124 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
is really a charitable trust or institution eligible for<br />
registration. The Court further held that once the<br />
registration under section 12A(a) of the Act is granted,<br />
the Income Tax Officer is not justified in refusing the<br />
benefit which would, otherwise, accrue under the<br />
registration.”<br />
108. In the case of Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax<br />
v. Surat City Gymkhana, (2008) 300 ITR 214 (SC), the<br />
Supreme Court was called upon to deal with the question as to<br />
whether on the facts and circumstances of the said case,<br />
Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was justified in law in holding<br />
that registration under section 12A was a fiat accompli to hold<br />
the Assessing Officer back from further probe into the objects<br />
of the trust. On a perusal of the judgment of the Gujarat High<br />
Court in the case of Hiralal Bhagwati, the Supreme Court<br />
held that the question stood concluded by the said judgment,<br />
which had attained finality since the revenue did not challenge<br />
the decision in the said case. The relevant observations made<br />
by the Supreme Court are as follows;<br />
“The respondent assessee claimed exemption under<br />
Section 10(23) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 for<br />
Assessment Years 1991-1992 and 1992-1993. The said<br />
exemption was claimed on the basis that the objects of<br />
the respondent assessee are exclusively charitable. The<br />
assessing officer rejected the claim. The appeals filed<br />
before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) were<br />
also dismissed. Aggrieved thereby, the assessee filed<br />
further appeals before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal<br />
(the Tribunal). The Tribunal, by order dated 20-1-2000,<br />
allowed the appeals filed by the respondent assessee.<br />
The appellant filed appeals before the High Court of<br />
Gujarat. The Revenue claimed that the following two<br />
substantial questions of law arise from the order of the<br />
Tribunal:<br />
“(A) Whether, on the facts and circumstances of the<br />
case, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was justified in<br />
law in holding that the objects of the trust restricting<br />
Page 125 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
benefit to the members of the club would fall within the<br />
purview of the act of ‘general public utility’ under<br />
Section 2(15) of the Income Tax Act constituting as a<br />
section of public and not a body of individuals?<br />
(B) Whether, on the facts and circumstances of the case,<br />
the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was justified in law in<br />
holding that registration under Section 12-A was a fait<br />
accompli to hold the assessing officer back from further<br />
probe into the objects of the trust?”<br />
2. By the impugned order, the High Court dismissed the<br />
appeals, in limine, relying on a decision of the same<br />
Court in Hiralal Bhagwati v. CIT 2000 246 ITR 188,<br />
holding that the questions raised in the appeals are<br />
covered by the aforesaid decision.<br />
3. Being dissatisfied by the order of the High Court, the<br />
Revenue has filed these appeals.<br />
4. This Court, on 22-7-2002, granted leave in respect of<br />
Question ‘B’ only. The appeals were not entertained in<br />
respect of Question ‘A’ and it was noted that the appeals<br />
were rightly dismissed by the High Court insofar as<br />
Question ‘A’ is concerned as the appellant did not<br />
challenge the correctness of the judgment in Hiralal<br />
Bhagwati.<br />
5. On a perusal of the judgment of the Gujarat High Court<br />
in Hiralal Bhagwati we now find that Question ‘B’ is also<br />
concluded by the said judgment (refer to the 1st<br />
paragraph of ITR p. 196). Since the Revenue did not<br />
challenge the decision in the said case, the same has<br />
attained finality. Question ‘B’, therefore, is to meet the<br />
same fate as Question ‘A’ as this Court had declined to<br />
grant leave in respect of Question ‘A’ on the ground that<br />
the Revenue did not challenge the correctness of the<br />
decision in Hiralal Bhagwati. It appears that the fact, that<br />
Question ‘B’ was also covered by the aforementioned<br />
judgment, was not brought to the notice of Their<br />
Lordships and, therefore, leave granted was restricted to<br />
Question ‘B’.”<br />
109. This High Court in the case of Ahmedabad Urban<br />
Development Authority v. Deputy Director of Income<br />
Tax (Exemption), (supra), has held thus:<br />
Page 126 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
“9. Section 12AA of the Act lays down the procedure for<br />
registration in relation to the conditions for applicability<br />
of sections 11 &#038; 12 as provided in section 12A of the Act.<br />
Therefore, once the procedure is complete as provided in<br />
sub-section (1) of section 12AA of the Act and a<br />
Certificate is issued granting registration to the Trust or<br />
Institution it is apparent that the same is a document<br />
evidencing satisfaction about : (1) genuineness of the<br />
activities of the Trust or institution, (2) about the objects<br />
of the Trust or Institution. Section 12A of the Act<br />
stipulates that provisions of sections 11 &#038; 12 shall not<br />
apply in relation to income of a Trust or an Institution<br />
unless conditions stipulated therein are fulfilled. Thus<br />
granting of registration under section 12AA of the Act<br />
denotes, as per legislative scheme, that conditions laid<br />
down in section 12A of the Act stand fulfilled.”<br />
110. This High Court, in the case of Agricultural Produce<br />
Market Committee vs. Income Tax Officer, reported in<br />
(2013) 355 ITR 384, held as under;<br />
“A perusal of the reasons recorded shows that the<br />
assessment is sought to be reopened on the ground that<br />
even if the petitioner has obtained registration under<br />
section 12AA of the Act as an institution carrying on<br />
charitable activities, the petitioner is not entitled to the<br />
status of trust carrying out charitable activities since the<br />
petitioner is conducting the business as an “Association<br />
of Persons” and not as a “Trust”. Thus, though the<br />
petitioner has been granted registration under section<br />
12AA of the Act by the Commissioner of Income-tax, the<br />
assessment is sought to be reopened on the basis of<br />
revenue audit objection that the petitioner is not eligible<br />
for exemption for the aforesaid reasons. The grounds for<br />
reopening the assessment are clearly contrary to the<br />
settled legal position as laid down by this Court in the<br />
case of Hiralal Bhagwati v. Commissioner of Income Tax,<br />
(supra) as well as in the case of Ahmedabad Urban<br />
Development Authority v. Deputy Director of Income Tax<br />
(Exemption), wherein the Court has held that section<br />
12AA of the Act lays down the procedure for registration<br />
in relation to the conditions for applicability of sections<br />
11 and 12 as provided in section 12A of the Act.<br />
Page 127 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
Therefore, once the procedure is complete as provided<br />
under sub-section (1) of section 12AA of the Act and a<br />
certificate is issued granting registration to the Trust or<br />
Institution, it is apparent that the same is a document<br />
evidencing satisfaction about: (1) genuineness of the<br />
activities of the trust or Institution, and (2) about the<br />
objects of the Trust or Institution. While framing the<br />
assessment order, it is not open to the Assessing Officer<br />
to ignore the certificate of registration granted under<br />
section 12AA of the Act by the Director of Income Tax<br />
(Exemption).<br />
In the facts of the present case, the Assessing Officer<br />
while framing the original assessment under section<br />
143(3) of the Act, has, taken into consideration the<br />
certificate granted by the Commissioner of Income Tax<br />
under section 12AA of the Act, and has found that the<br />
petitioner carries on charitable activities. In the return of<br />
income filed by it, the petitioner had specifically claimed<br />
deduction of Rs.32,40,212/- and Rs.45,00,000/- totalling<br />
to Rs.77,40,212/- as a Charitable Trust registered under<br />
section 12AA of the Act by the Commissioner of Income<br />
Tax. During the course of assessment proceedings the<br />
Assessing Officer had issued notice pursuant to which the<br />
petitioner had given its reply explaining as to why it was<br />
entitled to the said deductions. The Assessing Officer<br />
after considering the explanation given by the petitioner<br />
had passed a scrutiny assessment order under section<br />
143(3) of the Act specifically allowing the above<br />
deductions. From the reasons recorded, it is evident that<br />
the Assessing Officer has not recorded any independent<br />
opinion regarding income having escaped assessment for<br />
the reasons stated therein. The sole ground for reopening<br />
the assessment appears to be the observations of the<br />
Revenue Audit Party that the assessee is not eligible for<br />
exemption to the tune of Rs.77,40,212/- for the year<br />
under reference since, the Assessing Officer has not<br />
disallowed the exemption while finalizing the assessment<br />
under section 143(3) of the Act. Thus, it appears that the<br />
belief that income chargeable to tax escaped assessment<br />
is that of the Revenue Audit Party and not of the<br />
Assessing Officer. In the circumstances, the condition<br />
precedent for exercise of powers under section 147 of<br />
the Act, namely, that the Assessing Officer should have<br />
reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has<br />
escaped assessment, does not appear to be fulfilled in<br />
Page 128 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
the present case.<br />
Besides, in the light of the above referred decisions of<br />
this Court, it is not permissible for the Assessing Officer<br />
to go behind the registration obtained by the assessee<br />
under section 12AA of the Act. The Assessing Officer<br />
while framing original assessment having taking into<br />
consideration the registration under section 12AA of the<br />
Act as well as having examined the admissibility of the<br />
claims made by the petitioner, has allowed the deduction<br />
under section 11 of the Act. Under the circumstances, the<br />
reopening of assessment appears to be based on a mere<br />
change of opinion, that too, the opinion of the Revenue<br />
Audit Party and not that of the Assessing Officer.”<br />
111. The ratio discernible from the aforesaid decision is that<br />
once the procedure is completed as provided under subsection<br />
(1) of Section 12AA of the Act and a certificate is issued<br />
granting registration to the trust or institution, it is apparent<br />
that the same is a document evidencing satisfaction about (i)<br />
the genuineness of the activities of the trust or institution and<br />
(ii) about the objects of the trust or institution. While framing<br />
the assessment order, it is not open to the Assessing Officer to<br />
ignore the certificate of registration granted under Section<br />
12AA of the Act by the Director of Income Tax (Exemption). It<br />
is not permissible for the Assessing Officer to go behind the<br />
registration obtained by the assessee under Section 12AA of<br />
the Act.<br />
112. It is apposite to state that the definition of the term<br />
“charitable purpose” remains an inclusive one and is not an<br />
exhaustive or exclusive one. In other words, the purposes<br />
similar to those mentioned in the aforesaid definition could<br />
also constitute ‘charitable purpose&#8217; under the Act. The<br />
expression ‘charitable purpose’ is sufficiently wide in scope to<br />
include a variety of activities. For instance, promotion of sports<br />
Page 129 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
and games is a charitable purpose, as is promotion of trade<br />
and commerce, even when the beneficiaries are confined only<br />
to a particular line of trade or commodity. However, at the<br />
same time, the fact that remote and indirect benefits are<br />
derived by the members of the public will not be sufficient to<br />
make the purpose a “charitable purpose” under the Act.<br />
113. The word ‘Charity’ connotes altruism in thought and<br />
action. It involves an idea of benefiting others rather than<br />
oneself.<br />
114. For a trust to be accepted as a charitable trust for the<br />
purposes of exemption, it is necessary that the objects should<br />
be specific so as to confirm to the requirement of the income<br />
tax law in this regard. Where they are too wide, the trust may<br />
not qualify for exemption. However, a pragmatic view is<br />
required to be taken while examining the data. The material on<br />
record should be analysed objectively.<br />
115. The onus to prove that the objects are of charitable<br />
nature is on the assessee.<br />
116. In our considered opinion, the principle of purposive<br />
interpretation of the provision has to be adopted and when<br />
such a construction is placed, it serves the legislative intent.<br />
117. In this context we may refer to the decision in State of<br />
T.N. v. Kodaikanal Motor Union (P) Ltd., (1986) 62 STC 272<br />
(SC): (1989) 3 SCC 91, wherein the Supreme Court, after<br />
referring to K.P. Varghese vs. Income Tax Officer and and Luke<br />
v. Inland Revenue Commissioner, (1964) 54 ITR 692 (HL);<br />
(1963) AC 557 (HL), observed thus:-<br />
“The courts must always seek to find out the intention of<br />
the legislature. Though the courts must find out the<br />
intention of the statute from the language used, but<br />
Page 130 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
language more often than not is an imperfect instrument<br />
of expression of human thought. As Lord Denning said it<br />
would be idle to expect every statutory provision to be<br />
drafted with divine prescience and perfect clarity. As<br />
Judge Learned Hand said, we must not make a fortress<br />
out of dictionary but remember that statutes must have<br />
some purpose or object, whose imaginative discovery is<br />
judicial craftsmanship. We need not always cling to<br />
literalness and should seek to endeavour to avoid an<br />
unjust or absurd result. We should not make a mockery<br />
of legislation. To make sense out of an unhappily worded<br />
provision, where the purpose is apparent to the judicial<br />
eye ‘some’ violence to language is permissible.”<br />
118. In Keshavji Ravji and Co. v. CIT, (1990) 183 ITR 1 (SC);<br />
(1990) 2 SCC 231, it has been held by the Supreme Court that<br />
when in a taxation statute where literal interpretation leads to<br />
a result that does not sub-serve the object of the legislation<br />
another construction in consonance with the object can be<br />
adopted.<br />
119. We now propose to examine the matter, keeping in mind<br />
the fourth limb of Section 2(15) of the Act, i.e., “the<br />
advancement of any other object of general public utility”.<br />
120. The provision as it existed under the Act of 1922 was that<br />
once the purpose of the trust was relief of the poor, education,<br />
medical relief or advancement of any other object of general<br />
public utility, the trust was considered to be for a charitable<br />
purpose. As a result of the addition of the words &#8220;not involving<br />
the carrying on of any activity for profit&#8221; at the end of the<br />
definition in section 2(15) of the Act even if the purpose of the<br />
trust is &#8220;advancement of any other object of general public<br />
utility&#8221;, it would not be considered to be &#8220;charitable purpose&#8221;<br />
unless it is shown that the above purpose does not involve the<br />
Page 131 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
carrying of any activity for profit. The result, thus, of the<br />
change in the definition is that in order to bring a case within<br />
the fourth category of charitable purpose, it would be<br />
necessary to show that :<br />
(i) the purpose of the trust is advancement of any other object<br />
of general public utility, and<br />
(ii) the above purpose does not involve the carrying on of any<br />
activity for profit.<br />
121. Both the above conditions must be satisfied before the<br />
purpose of the trust can be held to be charitable purpose.<br />
122. A brief analysis of all the provisions would show that (i)<br />
providing relief of the poor; (ii) establishing institution for<br />
education; (ii) providing medical relief; and (iv) to advance any<br />
other object of general public utility are included within the<br />
definition of ‘charitable purposes’. With effect from<br />
01.04.2009, a new definition has been substituted, in that, if<br />
the advancement of object of general public utility involves<br />
carrying on any activity in the nature of trade, commerce or<br />
business or any activity of rendering any service in relation to<br />
any trade, commerce or business for cess or fee or any other<br />
consideration, such activity shall not be a charitable purpose.<br />
Except the addition of the proviso, restricting the purport of<br />
the ‘advancement of any other object of general public utility’,<br />
there is not much difference in section 2(15) as it existed prior<br />
to 01.04.2009, and thereafter. After the amendment the<br />
preservation of environment including the watersheds, forest<br />
and wild life, and preservation of monuments or places/objects<br />
of artistic or historic interest are also included in the definition<br />
‘charitable purpose’. Be that as it is, what is important is any<br />
Page 132 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
institution or organization or entity for the advancement of<br />
object of general public utility is also considered as an<br />
institution or trust for charitable purpose. Section 11 exempts<br />
various categories of incomes as enumerated under section<br />
11(1)(a) to (d) from the total income of the previous year.<br />
Section 12 exempts the voluntary contributions received by a<br />
trust created for charitable purposes from the total income.<br />
The benefit of Section 11 and/or 12 can be claimed only when<br />
the conditions as stipulated under Section 12A are satisfied.<br />
One such condition is that a person in receipt of the income<br />
has to apply for the registration of the trust or institution in the<br />
prescribed form on or before the expiry of a period of one year<br />
from the date of creation of the trust or establishment of<br />
institution. The proviso to Section 12A(1) confers the power on<br />
the Commissioner to entertain an application under Section<br />
12A (1) even after the expiry of period of one year if he is<br />
satisfied that the person was prevented from making an<br />
application before the expiry of period of one year for sufficient<br />
reasons.<br />
123. Section 11(5) requires every trust or institution for a<br />
charitable purpose to invest or deposit the money only in the<br />
manner provided therein inter alia investment in Savings<br />
Certificates as defined in Government Savings Certificates Act,<br />
1959, deposit with the Post Office Savings Bank, deposit in any<br />
account with the scheduled bank i.e., Reserve Bank of India or<br />
its subsidiary bank or any scheduled bank under Section 3 of<br />
the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of<br />
Undertakings) Act, 1980 or any other bank being a bank<br />
included in Second Schedule to Reserve Bank of India Act,<br />
Page 133 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
1934 and the like. The breach of Section 11(5) would<br />
attract Section 13(1)(d) of the IT Act and the benefit under<br />
Sections 11 and 12 would not be available if funds are<br />
deposited or invested contrary to Section 11(5) or in breach of<br />
Section 13(1) generally and Section 13(1)(d) specifically.<br />
124. In CIT vs. Andhra Chamber of Commerce, (1965) 55<br />
ITR 722 (SC), the Supreme Court considered the question as to<br />
whether the income of Andhra Chamber of Commerce is<br />
exempt under Section 4(3)(i) of the Income tax Act, 1922.<br />
While observing that the legislature had used language of<br />
great amplitude in defining ‘charitable purpose’ and referring<br />
to the Trustees of Tribune, the Court held that the Chamber of<br />
Commerce is a charitable institution although it was promoting<br />
the interest of trade and commerce, which were only ancillary<br />
and subsidiary objects. While observing that the primary object<br />
being, “to promote and protect trade, commerce and<br />
industries, to aid, stimulate and promote the development of<br />
trade, commerce and industries, and to watch over and protect<br />
the general commercial interests of India”, the Court held as<br />
under.<br />
“The expression “object of general public utility” in<br />
Section 4(3) would prima facie include all objects which<br />
promote the welfare of the general public. It cannot be<br />
said that a purpose would cease to be charitable even if<br />
public welfare is intended to be served thereby if it<br />
includes the taking of steps to urge or oppose legislation<br />
affecting trade, commerce or manufacture. If the primary<br />
purpose be advancement of objects of general public<br />
utility, it would remain charitable even if an incidental<br />
entry into the political domain for achieving that purpose,<br />
e.g., promotion of or opposition to legislation concerning<br />
that purpose, is contemplated. “<br />

C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
125. In Addl. Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Surat Art<br />
Silk, (1980) 121 ITR 1 (SC), a Constitution Bench of the<br />
Supreme Court interpreting the words ‘not involving the<br />
carrying on of any activity for profit’ occurring in section 2(15)<br />
(as it existed), held that the test of predominant object has to<br />
be applied while deciding whether an entity is a charitable<br />
trust/institution and that profit making by such institution is<br />
not excluded. The relevant observations are as follows.<br />
“Therefore, for a purpose to fall under the fourth head of<br />
“charitable purpose”, it must constitute the advancement<br />
of an object of general public utility in which the activity<br />
of advancement must not involve a profit making<br />
activity. The word “involving” in the restrictive clause is<br />
not without significance. An activity is involved in the<br />
advancement of an object when it is enwrapped or<br />
enveloped in the activity of advancement. In another<br />
case, it may be interwoven into the activity of<br />
advancement, so that the resulting activity has a dual<br />
nature or is twin faceted. Since we are concerned with<br />
the definition of “charitable purpose”, and the definition<br />
defines in its entirety a “purpose” only, it will be more<br />
appropriate to speak of the purpose of profit making<br />
being enwrapped or enveloped in the purpose of the<br />
advancement of an object of general public utility or, in<br />
the other kind of case, the purpose of profit making being<br />
interwoven into the purpose of the advancement of that<br />
object giving rise to a purpose possessing a dual nature<br />
or twin facets. Now, section 2(15) clearly says that to<br />
constitute a “charitable purpose” the purpose of profit<br />
making must be excluded. In my opinion, the<br />
requirement is satisfied where there is either a total<br />
absence of the purpose of profit making or it is so<br />
insignificant compared to the purpose of advancement of<br />
the object of general public utility that the dominating<br />
role of the latter rendersthe former unworthy of account.<br />
If the profit making purpose holds a dominating role or<br />
even constitutes an equal component with the purpose of<br />
advancement of the object of general public utility, then<br />
clearly the definition in section 2(15) is not satisfied.<br />
When applying Section 11, it is open to the tax authority<br />
in an appropriate case to pierce the veil of what is<br />
Page 135 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
proclaimed on the surface by the document constituting<br />
the trust or establishing the institution, and enter into an<br />
ascertainment of the true purpose of the trust or<br />
institution. The true purpose must be genuinely and<br />
essentially charitable. “<br />
126. In CIT vs. Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport<br />
Corporation, (1986) 159 ITR 1 (SC), the question was whether<br />
the income of the APSRTC was exempt from income tax under<br />
section 4(3)(i). On a reference by the Income Tax Appellate<br />
Tribunal, the High Court answered the question in the<br />
affirmative in favour of the assessee. Following Trustees of the<br />
Tribune, the Supreme Court affirmed the High Court’s view<br />
observing as under.<br />
“It is admitted position, as pointed out by the High Court<br />
in its judgment under appeal, that no share capital has<br />
been raised under Section 23(2) and the entire capital<br />
has been provided by the government under Section<br />
23(1) and the Government is only paid interest thereon<br />
under Section 28(1) just as interest would be paid on any<br />
money due as a debt. That the activity of the respondent<br />
Corporation is not carried on with the object of making<br />
profit is made abundantly clear by the provisions of<br />
section 30 under which, prior to the amendment of that<br />
section by the Amendment Act of 1959, the balance<br />
of income left, after utilization of the net profits for the<br />
purpose set out in section 30, was to be made over to the<br />
State Government for the purpose of road development<br />
and after the Amendment Act of 1959 is to be utilized<br />
for financing the expansion programmes of the<br />
respondent corporation and the remainder, if any, is to<br />
be made over to the State Government for the purpose of<br />
road development. As pointed out by this Court in Andhra<br />
Pradesh Road Transport Corporation v ITO (1964) 52 ITR<br />
524 (SC), the amount handed over to the State<br />
Government does not become a part of the general<br />
revenues of the State but is impressed with an obligation<br />
that it should be utilized only for the purpose for which it<br />
is entrusted, namely, road development. It is not, and<br />
cannot be, disputed that road development is an object<br />
of general public utility.”<br />

127. CIT vs. Agricultural Produce and Market<br />
Committee, (2007) 291 ITR 419 (Bom) is a case wherein the<br />
Bombay High Court considered the question whether the<br />
market committees constituted under the Maharashtra<br />
Agricultural Produce Marketing (Regulation) Act, 1963<br />
are established for charitable purposes and whether they can<br />
be registered under section 12A/12AA of the Act. After<br />
referring to the various provisions of the Maharashtra Act – the<br />
preamble, the powers and duties of market committees, the<br />
power to levy and collect fees and regulate the markets, the<br />
Court relied on Surat Art Silk (supra) and held as under. (paras<br />
22 and 24)<br />
“Applying the tests laid down by the apex court in the<br />
aforesaid cases to the facts of the present case, there<br />
can be no doubt that the object of the market<br />
committees (assessees) established under the 1963 Act<br />
is to regulate the entire marketing of agricultural and<br />
some other produce from the stage of procuring till it<br />
reaches the ultimate consumer, which is squarely<br />
covered within the meaning of the expression<br />
&#8220;advancement of any object of general public utility&#8221;<br />
contained in section 2(15) of the Act.<br />
It is pertinent to note that prior to April 1,1984, the words<br />
used in section 2(15) of the Act were &#8220;advancement of<br />
any other object of general public utility not involving the<br />
carrying on of any activity for profit&#8221;. By the Finance Act,<br />
1983 with effect from April 1, 1984, Legislature has<br />
omitted the words &#8220;not involving the carrying on of any<br />
activity for profit&#8221; from section 2(15) of the Act. Thus,<br />
after April 1, 1984, even if there is some profit in the<br />
activity carried on by the trust/institution, so long as the<br />
dominant object is of general public utility, it cannot be<br />
said that the said trust/institution is not established for<br />
charitable purposes. “<br />
128. In CIT vs. Market Committee, (2007) 294 ITR 563<br />
Page 137 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
(P&#038;H), the Punjab and Haryana High Court, after considering<br />
the provisions of the Punjab Agricultural Produce Markets Act,<br />
1961 held that the market committee incorporated in terms of<br />
Section 18 of the Punjab Act is a body corporate and that<br />
its activities can be included within the definition of the term<br />
charitable purposes. It was also held that the exemptions<br />
under sections 10, 11 and 12 of the Act are independent of one<br />
another and merely because an assessee is not entitled to<br />
claim exemption under one of the aforesaid provisions that<br />
cannot ipso facto lead to the conclusion that the claim of the<br />
assessee cannot be considered for the grant of tax exemption<br />
in some other provisions of the IT Act. The relevant<br />
observations are as follows.<br />
“It is apparent from the duties and responsibilities of the<br />
market committees, delineated in the foregoing two<br />
paragraphs, that a market committee, in the background<br />
of the provisions of the Markets Act, should be treated as<br />
a body, discharging &#8220;legal obligation&#8221;(s) within the<br />
meaning of Section 13(7) of the Income Tax Act. The<br />
duties and responsibilities discharged by a market<br />
committee, envisaged under the provisions of the<br />
Markets Act, referred to above, also lead us to conclude,<br />
that the activities of a market committee can be included<br />
within the definition of the term &#8220;charitable purpose&#8221;,<br />
defined by Section 2(15) of the Income Tax Act. The<br />
instant conclusion is inevitable from a cumulative reading<br />
and interpretation of Sections 13, 26 and 28 of the<br />
Markets Act (analysed in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5<br />
hereinabove). Briefly stated, it may be noticed, that the<br />
obligations discharged by a market committee include<br />
the regulation of purchase, sale, storage and processing<br />
of agricultural produce with the intention of benefiting<br />
the producers, as well as, the consumers of agricultural<br />
products. A market committee is also obliged to provide<br />
for conveniences for the activities of a market area like<br />
construction of buildings, sheds, plinths, etc. A market<br />
committee is also obliged to provide conveniences for<br />
persons visiting a market area, like providing for shelter,<br />
shade and parking facilities. A market committee is also<br />
Page 138 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
obliged to look after the safety, health and convenience<br />
of persons visiting the market area. A market committee<br />
is also obliged to construct and repair link roads,<br />
approach roads, culverts, and bridges, etc. One of the<br />
many specified activities of a market committee is to<br />
extend loans to financially weak communities as well as<br />
in the repayment of such loans and the interest thereon.<br />
The market committee under reference, in the discharge<br />
of its obligations, besides carrying out all the aforesaid<br />
activities, is stated to have spent a huge sum of money<br />
for the construction, development and repair of link<br />
roads, culverts, bridges, etc “<br />
129. In CIT vs. Gujarat Maritime Board, (2007) 295 ITR 561<br />
(SC), the question before the Supreme Court was whether<br />
Maritime Board is entitled to the status of charitable institution<br />
under Section 11 of the Act. Maritime Board was constituted<br />
under the Gujarat Maritime Board Act for the purpose of<br />
development of minor ports in Gujarat. Under the statute, the<br />
Board also renders stevedoring, transport and shipping<br />
services besides maintaining the jetties, wharfs, roads, lights<br />
etc. The management and control of the Board was with the<br />
State Government. There was no profit motive and the income<br />
earned by the Board has to be deployed for the development<br />
of minor ports in Gujarat. It was registered as ‘local authority’<br />
under Section 3(31) of the General Clauses Act, 1897.<br />
Prior to 2002, it was availing exemption as local authority<br />
under Section 10(20) of the IT Act and, therefore, was not<br />
exigible to the income tax. After insertion of the explanation in<br />
Section 10(20), the expression ‘local authority’ was confined to<br />
Panchayats, Municipality, Municipal Committee, District Board<br />
and Cantonment Board. Maritime Board did not come within<br />
the definition of local authority. They, therefore, made an<br />
application to the Commissioner for being registered as a<br />
Page 139 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
charitable institution as defined under section 2(15). The<br />
Commissioner rejected the application. The Tribunal as well as<br />
the High Court of Gujarat held that the Maritime Board is a<br />
charitable institution. The Supreme Court, while construing<br />
Section 2(15) and Section 11(1), relied on the Andhra<br />
Chamber of Commerce (supra), Surat Art Silk (supra) and<br />
APSRTC (supra) and held that the Maritime Board is entitled to<br />
be registered as a ‘charitable trust’ under Section 12A of the<br />
Act. The relevant observations are as follows. ;<br />
“For the purposes of this section ‘property held under<br />
trust’ includes a business undertaking so held, and where<br />
a claim is made that the income of any such undertaking<br />
shall not be included in the total income of the persons in<br />
receipt thereof, the assessing officer shall have power to<br />
determine the income of such undertaking in accordance<br />
with the provisions of this Act relating to assessment;<br />
and where any income so determined is in excess of the<br />
income as shown in the accounts of the undertaking,<br />
such excess shall be deemed to be applied to purposes<br />
other than charitable or religious purposes.<br />
According to section 2(15), the expression “charitable<br />
purpose” has been defined by way of an inclusive<br />
definition so as to include relief to the poor, education,<br />
medical relief and advancement of any other object of<br />
general public utility. In this case we are concerned with<br />
the interpretation of the expression “advancement of any<br />
other object of general public utility.<br />
Under Section 11(1), income from property held for<br />
charitable purposes is not includible and does not form<br />
part of total income.<br />
Section 11(1) has three sub-sections, (a), (b) and (c). In<br />
all the three sub-sections the words used are “income<br />
derived from property held under trust wholly for<br />
charitable purposes”. Under Section 11(4) the expression<br />
“property held under trust” includes a business<br />
undertaking so held. In other words, income from<br />
business undertaking held for charitable purposes can fall<br />
under Section 11 subject to such income fulfilling the<br />
requisite conditions of that section &#8230;<br />
Page 140 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
.. At the outset, we may point out that Section 10(20)<br />
and Section 11 of the 1961 Act operate in totally<br />
different spheres. Even if the Board has ceased to be a<br />
“local authority”, it is not precluded from claiming<br />
exemption under Section 11(1) of the 1961 Act.<br />
Therefore we have to read Section 11(1) in the light of<br />
the definition of the words “charitable purposes” as<br />
defined under Section 2(15) of the 1961 Act.<br />
We have perused number of decisions of this Court which<br />
have interpreted the words in section 2(15), namely,<br />
“any other object of general public utility”. From the said<br />
decisions it emerges that the said expression is of the<br />
widest connotation. The word “general” in the said<br />
expression means pertaining to a whole class. Therefore,<br />
advancement of any object of benefit to the public or a<br />
section of the public as distinguished from benefit to an<br />
individual or a group of individuals would be a charitable<br />
purpose (CIT v. Ahmedabad Rana Caste Assn (1983) 140<br />
ITR 1 (SC)). The said expression would prima facie<br />
include all objects which promote the welfare of the<br />
general public. It cannot be said that a purpose would<br />
cease to be charitable even if public welfare is intended<br />
to be served. If the primary purpose and the predominant<br />
object are to promote the welfare of the general public<br />
the purpose would be charitable purpose. When an object<br />
is to promote or protect the interest of a particular trade<br />
or industry that object becomes an object of public utility,<br />
but not so if it seeks to promote the interest of those who<br />
conduct the said trade or industry (CIT v. Andhra<br />
Chamber of Commerce (1965) 55 ITR 722 (SC). If the<br />
primary or predominant object of an institution is<br />
charitable, any other object which might not be<br />
charitable but which is ancillary or incidental to the<br />
dominant purpose, would not prevent the institution from<br />
being a valid charity (CIT v. Surat Art Silk Cloth<br />
Manufacturers’ Assn (1980) 121 ITR 1 (SC). “<br />
130. The apex Court in the case of Surat Art Silk Cloth<br />
Manufacturers Association (supra) has pointed out that the<br />
restriction must be read with &#8220;the advancement of any other<br />
object of general public utility&#8221; and not &#8220;object of general<br />
public utility&#8221;. The Supreme Court, considering the English<br />
Page 141 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
decisions and the Indian law, has pointed out in the aforesaid<br />
decision that :<br />
&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; There is no such limitation so far as Indian law is<br />
concerned even if a purpose is not within the spirit and<br />
intendment of the preamble to the statute of Elizabeth, it<br />
would be charitable if it falls within the definition of<br />
&#8220;charitable purpose&#8221; given in the statute Every object of<br />
general public utility would, therefore, be charitable<br />
under the Indian law, subject only to the condition<br />
imposed by the carrying on of any activity for profit&#8221;<br />
added in the present Act. &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;<br />
131. The apex Court in the case of CIT vs. Federation of Indian<br />
Chambers of Commerce &#038; Industry (1981) 130 ITR 186 (SC),<br />
after applying the principle laid down in the case of Surat Art<br />
Silk Cloth Manufacturers Association (supra), held as under :<br />
&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. the income derived by the respondent from the<br />
activities, such as holding the Indian Trade Fair and<br />
sponsoring the conference of the Afro-Asian Organisation,<br />
were for the advancement of the dominant object and<br />
purpose of the Federation, viz. promotion, protection and<br />
development of trade, commerce and industry in India,<br />
and were exempt from tax under s. 11(1)(a) r/w s.<br />
2(15) &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;<br />
132. The Apex Court in Ahmedabad Rana Caste Association vs.<br />
CIT, (1971) 82 ITR 704 (SC) and CIT vs. Ahmedabad Rana<br />
Caste Association (1983) 140 ITR 1 (SC) pointed out that the<br />
law recognises no purpose as charitable unless it is for a public<br />
charity. That is to say, a purpose must, in order to be<br />
charitable, be directed to the benefit of the community or a<br />
section of the community. The expression &#8220;object of general<br />
public utility&#8221;, however, is not restricted to the objects<br />
beneficial to the whole mankind. An object beneficial to a<br />
section of the public is an object of general public utility. The<br />
Page 142 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
section of the community sought to be benefited must<br />
undoubtedly be sufficiently defined and identifiable &#8230;&#8230;..<br />
quality of a public or impersonal nature.<br />
133. The apex Court in the case of Kamla Town Trust (supra),<br />
after considering the facts of that case, viz., the trust deed and<br />
the rectification agreement, expressed an opinion as under :<br />
&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. On the contrary it becomes clear on a close<br />
reading of relevant provisions of this clause that the<br />
objects are specific and charitable in nature. The<br />
beneficiaries are also clearly indicated. There is also no<br />
ambiguity about the trustees or the trust properties. Thus<br />
all the basic requirements for creation of a public<br />
charitable trust do exist on the express language of the<br />
relevant clauses of rectified deed. &#8230;..&#8221;<br />
134. We may also refer to and rely upon the decision of this<br />
Court in the case of Additional Commissioner of Income<br />
Tax, Gujarat vs. Ahmedabad, Millowners Association,<br />
reported in 1977 (106) ITR 725, wherein this Court held as<br />
under;<br />
“22. We now proceed to consider whether an object<br />
which serves personal interest would fall within the scope<br />
of section 2(15) of the Act. There is no dispute that the<br />
charitable purposes of relief to poor and educational and<br />
medical relief have no relevance to the facts of the<br />
present case. It is, therefore, the fourth category of the<br />
charitable purpose, namely, the object of general public<br />
utility, with which we are concerned in this case. The<br />
expression &#8220;object of general public utility &#8221; appearing in<br />
section 2(15) would include only those objects which<br />
promote the welfare of general public and not the<br />
personal and individual interests of some persons. It is<br />
not uncommon to find the objects of general public utility<br />
being in conflict with the object of personal welfare of<br />
some specified individuals. It is true, as held by the<br />
Supreme Court in the case of Andhra Chamber of<br />
Commerce [1965] 55 ITR 722 (SC), that personal welfare<br />
Page 143 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
of specified individuals would be incidental or<br />
consequential to the main purpose of general public<br />
utility, but a converse of this proposition is not always<br />
true. Now, if we examine the objects contained in clauses<br />
(a), (b) and (c) from this point of view, it will be at once<br />
noticed that these objects seek to protect the interest of<br />
&#8220;millowners and users of motive power&#8221; and also of those<br />
concerned with them. Clause (b) contemplates the<br />
promotion of good relations between the persons and<br />
bodies using such powers and clause (c), which is<br />
consequential to clause (a) and (b), contemplates doing<br />
of those acts and things by which the objects covered by<br />
clause (a) and (b) may be attained. Thus, all these three<br />
clause aim at protecting personal interest and not public<br />
interests. If this is so, the respondent-association is<br />
bound to carry on its activity keeping in mind the<br />
narrower concept of promoting the personal and selfserving<br />
interests of individuals who are consider<br />
&#8220;millowners and users of motive power&#8221; even when their<br />
interest are in conflict with the interests of their own<br />
trade or industry. If and when this happens, how can it be<br />
said that the respondent-association has carried out an<br />
object of general public utility ? General public is<br />
undoubtedly interested in trade, commerce or industry<br />
conducted by individuals, but it is surely not interested in<br />
protecting the personal interests of these individuals if<br />
they are in conflict with the interests of trade, commerce<br />
and industry. Therefore, when an object seeks to<br />
promote or protect the interests of a particular trade or<br />
industry, that object becomes an object of public utility,<br />
but not so, if it seeks to promote the interests of those<br />
who conduct the said trade or industry.<br />
23. This distinction between the protection of the<br />
interests of individuals and the protection of interests of<br />
an activity, which is of general public utility, goes to the<br />
root of the whole problem, and, hence, the Supreme<br />
Court has pointedly referred to this problem in<br />
Commissioner of Income-tax v. Andhra Chamber of<br />
Commerce [1965] 55 ITR 722 (SC) at page 727 of the<br />
report by observing as under :<br />
&#8220;It may be remembered that promotion and protection of<br />
trade, commerce and industry cannot be equated with<br />
promotion and protection of activities and interests<br />
merely of persons engaged in trade, commerce and<br />
Page 144 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
industry.&#8221;<br />
24. In this case, the Supreme Court has pointed out that<br />
even an object beneficial to a section of the public is an<br />
object of public utility and that to serve a charitable<br />
purpose, it is not necessary that the object should be to<br />
benefit the whole mankind or person living in a particular<br />
country or province. But, while making these<br />
observations, the Supreme Court has been careful in<br />
pointing out the distinction between &#8221; a section of the<br />
public &#8221; and specified individuals. Even so far as &#8220;a<br />
section of the public&#8221; is concerned, the Supreme Court<br />
has been particular in identifying it in the following terms<br />
(page 729) :<br />
&#8220;The section of the community sought to be benefited<br />
must undoubtedly be sufficiently defined and identifiable<br />
by some common quality of a public or impersonal nature<br />
: where there was no common quality uniting the<br />
potential beneficiaries into a class, it might not be<br />
regarded as valid.&#8221;<br />
25. These observations are repeated by the Supreme<br />
Court in the subsequent decision in Ahmedabad Rana<br />
Caste Association v. Commissioner of Income-tax [1971]<br />
82 ITR 704 (SC).<br />
26. These observations supply a complete answer to the<br />
contention of the learned Advocate-General that the<br />
category of persons covered by the expression<br />
&#8220;millowners and users of motive power&#8221; constitutes a<br />
section of the public, which can legitimately form the<br />
object of a charitable purpose. The observations make it<br />
clear that the section of the public which is to be<br />
benefited to make the purpose a charitable one should<br />
have a common quality of either a &#8220;public&#8221; nature or an<br />
&#8220;impersonal&#8221; nature. Can it be said that &#8220;millowners and<br />
users of motive power&#8221; have a common quality of a<br />
&#8220;public nature&#8221; ? If they have any common quality the<br />
same is obviously of a &#8220;private&#8221; nature, as each one of<br />
them is concerned with his own interest and shares<br />
nothing in common with the public. It was contended that<br />
their common quality is the fact that each one of them is<br />
either a millowner or a user of motive power. Granting<br />
that this is their common quality, it cannot be said that<br />
the said common quality possesses the attributes of a<br />
public or impersonal nature. If individuals, whose only<br />
common quality is their profession or vocation, can<br />
Page 145 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
legitimately be invested with the attributes of a public<br />
nature, then every partnership, company or an<br />
association of persons can be an object of charity, and<br />
the trusts created for the benefit of such partnerships,<br />
companies and associations would be charitable trusts<br />
earning exemption under section 11. Absurdity of such a<br />
situation cannot be over-emphasised.<br />
27. What is the exact nature of &#8220;section of the public&#8221;<br />
which can legitimately become an object of a charity, is<br />
considered by Lord Greene M.R. in Powell v. Compton<br />
[1945] 1 Ch 123, 129 (CA). In that case a bequest was<br />
made for the education of a small number of individual<br />
relatives of a testatrix. The question which arose was<br />
whether these individuals formed a &#8220;section of the<br />
public&#8221; so as to make the trust a charitable trust. Lord<br />
Greene M. R. held that the trust was not a valid trust,<br />
making the following observations :<br />
&#8220;No definition of what is meant by a section of the public<br />
has, so far as I am aware, been laid down, and I certainly<br />
do not propose to be the first to make the attempt to<br />
define it. In the case of many charitable gifts it is possible<br />
to identify the individuals who are to benefit, or who at<br />
any given moment constitute the class from which the<br />
beneficiaries are to be selected. This circumstance does<br />
not, however, deprive the gift of its public character.<br />
Thus, if there is a gift to relieve the poor inhabitants of a<br />
parish the class to benefit is readily ascertainable. But<br />
they do not enjoy the benefit, when they receive it, by<br />
virtue of their character as individuals but by virtue of<br />
their membership of the specified class. In such case the<br />
common quality which unites the potential beneficiaries<br />
into a class is essentially an impersonal one. It is<br />
definable by reference to what each has in common with<br />
the others, and that is something into which their status<br />
as individuals does not enter.&#8221;<br />
28. Our Supreme Court has approved of this principle in<br />
Ahmedabad Rana Caste Association&#8217;s case [1971] 82 ITR<br />
704 (SC) and has held that members of Rana caste has a<br />
relationship which was an impersonal one dependent<br />
upon their status a members of that caste. No such<br />
relationship of impersonal nature can be found amongst<br />
the millowners and users of motive power, and, hence,<br />
none of the objects mentioned in clause (a), (b) and (c)<br />
can be treated as objects of public utility.<br />
Page 146 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
29. We have already dealt with the object found in clause<br />
(d). So far as the object contained in clause (e) is<br />
concerned it consists of two parts. This first part<br />
contemplates establishment or the creation of funds to<br />
benefit employees of the association or the dependents<br />
of such persons while the second part contemplates<br />
subscriptions, donations or guarantees or &#8220;charitable or<br />
benevolent&#8221; purposes at the discretion of the association.<br />
Now, so far as the first part is concerned, it is covered by<br />
the decision in Oppenheim v. Tobacco Securities Trust<br />
Co. Ltd. [1951] AC 297 (HL), to which reference is made<br />
by the Supreme Court in Ahmedabad Rana Caste<br />
Association&#8217;s case [1971] 82 ITR 704 (SC) at page 710 of<br />
the report. The facts of that English decision were that<br />
the trustees were directed to apply certain income in<br />
providing for the education of children of employees or<br />
&#8220;former employees&#8221; of a British limited company or any<br />
of its subsidiary or allied companies. The House of Lords<br />
held in this case by majority that though the group of<br />
persons indicated was numerous, the nexus between<br />
them was employment by particular employers and,<br />
accordingly, the trust did not satisfy the test of a public<br />
benefit requisite to establish it as charitable. This<br />
principle has been approved by our Supreme Court and,<br />
therefore, the first part of the object clause (e) is also not<br />
found to be for general public utility within the meaning<br />
of section of section 2(15) of the Act. So far as the<br />
second part is concerned, Shri Kaji&#8217;s contention was that<br />
a benevolent purpose is not necessarily a charitable<br />
purpose but if this clause is constructed liberally, it may<br />
be said that it embodies within it the object of public<br />
utility. Now, proceeding to clause (f) it contemplates<br />
promotion of good relation between the employers and<br />
the employees. So far as this object is concerned, the<br />
matter is concluded by the decision of the Supreme Court<br />
in the above referred case of Commissioner of Incometax<br />
v. Indian Sugar Mills Association [1974] 97 ITR 486<br />
(SC), wherein the relevant clause which the court<br />
considered was &#8220;to promote good relations between the<br />
employers and the employees&#8221;. This clause was exactly<br />
similar to clause (f) with which we are concerned in this<br />
reference. With regard to such a clause, the Supreme<br />
Court has observed that even assuming that in some<br />
remote and indirect manner such an object might be<br />
some public utility, it cannot be called a charitable<br />
purpose within the meaning of section 4(3)(i) of the<br />
Page 147 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
Indian Income-tax Act, 1922. In view of this decision,<br />
even the object mentioned in clause (f) cannot be<br />
considered as the object serving any public utility.<br />
30. If we closely scrutinise the objects contained in rule<br />
3, we find that a substantial part of these objects benefit<br />
the association&#8217;s own members, those connected with<br />
them, and their employees. It is no doubt true that the<br />
beneficiaries of these objects are also who are nonmembers<br />
but who happen to be millowners or users of<br />
motive power. But that aspect of the matter does not<br />
detract from the fact all the members, and their<br />
employees, and &#8220;those who are connected&#8221; with<br />
members, from the substantial part of the recipients of<br />
the benefits contemplated by the objects. In<br />
Commissioner of Inland Revenue v. City of Glasgow<br />
Police Athletic Association [1953] 34 TC 76 (HL) Lord<br />
Cohen has summarised the legal position in such cases<br />
as under at page 105 of the report :<br />
&#8220;(1) If the main purpose of the body of persons is<br />
charitable and the only elements in its constitution and<br />
operations which are non-charitable are merely incidental<br />
to that main purpose, that body of persons is a charity<br />
notwithstanding the presence of those elements &#8211; Royal<br />
College of Surgeons of England v. National Provincial<br />
Bank [1952] AC 631 (HL).<br />
(2) If, however, a non-charitable object is itself one of the<br />
purposes of the body of persons and is not merely<br />
incidental to the charitable purposes, the body of persons<br />
is not a body of persons formed for charitable purposes<br />
only, within the meaning of the Income Tax Acts &#8211; Oxford<br />
Group v. Inland Revenue Commissioner [1949] 2 All ER<br />
537; 31 TC 221 (CA).<br />
(3) If a substantial part of the objects of the body of<br />
person is to benefit its own members, the body of<br />
persons is not established for charitable purposes only &#8211;<br />
Inland Revenue Commissioner v. Yorkshire Agricultural<br />
Society [1928] 1 KB 611 (CA).&#8221;<br />
135. In our opinion, the case on hand falls within the first<br />
category mentioned by Lord Cohent.”<br />
Page 148 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
136. It is important to note that prior to the introduction of the<br />
Proviso to Section 2(15) of the Act, the assessee-Association<br />
was granted registration under Section 12A of the Act. From<br />
this, it is clear that prior to the introduction of the Proviso to<br />
Section 2(15) of the Act, the authority, upon due consideration<br />
of all the relevant aspects, arrived at the satisfaction that the<br />
assessee-Association was established for charitable purposes..<br />
The Association continues to be recognised as a charitable<br />
institution. The certificate issued under Section 12A, after due<br />
inquiry, is still in force. If the Proviso had not been introduced<br />
by virtue of the Finance Act, 2008 w.e.f 1st April, 2009, the<br />
assessee Association would have been recognized as a charity<br />
and would have been recognized as an institution established<br />
for the purpose of advancement of an object of general public<br />
utility. The argument of the learned senior counsel on behalf of<br />
the Revenue is that in view of the introduction of the Proviso<br />
to Section 2(15), the assessee-Association is not entitled to<br />
seek exemption. The said proviso has two parts. The first part<br />
has reference to the carrying on of any activity in the nature of<br />
trade, commerce or business. The second part has reference to<br />
any activity of rendering any service ―in relation to any trade,<br />
commerce or business. Both these parts are further subject to<br />
the condition that the activities so carried out are for a cess or<br />
fee or any other consideration, irrespective of the nature or<br />
use or application or retention of the income from such<br />
activities. In other words, if, by virtue of a cess&#8217; or fee&#8217; or any<br />
other consideration, income is generated by any of the two<br />
sets of activities referred to above, the nature of use of such<br />
income or application or retention of such income is irrelevant<br />
for the purposes of construing the activities as charitable or<br />
not.<br />
Page 149 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
137. To be clear, if an activity in the nature of trade,<br />
commerce or business is carried on and it generates income,<br />
the fact that such income is applied for charitable purposes,<br />
would not make any difference and the activity would<br />
nonetheless not be regarded as being carried on for a<br />
charitable purpose. We have seen that by virtue of Section 25<br />
of the Companies Act, the petitioner is enjoined to plough back<br />
its income in furtherance of its object and the declaration of<br />
dividends is prohibited. If a literal interpretation is to be given<br />
to the proviso, then it may be concluded that this fact would<br />
have no bearing on determining the nature of the activity<br />
carried on by the petitioner. But, we feel that in deciding<br />
whether any activity is in the nature of trade, commerce or<br />
business, it has to be examined whether there is an element of<br />
profit making or not. Similarly, while considering whether any<br />
activity is one of rendering any service in relation to any trade,<br />
commerce or business, the element of profit making is also<br />
very important.<br />
138. The Delhi High Court in the case of Addl.<br />
Commissioner of Income Tax, Delhi vs. Delhi Brick Kiln<br />
Owners Association, reported in 1981 (130) ITR 55. In the<br />
said case, M/s. Delhi Brick Kiln Owners Association was the<br />
respondent assessee. The association had obtained a license<br />
from the Central Government for its registration under Section<br />
26 of the Indian Companies Act, 1913. The following were the<br />
objects of the company;<br />
“(a) To promote, develop and protect the brick kiln trade,<br />
commerce and industries.<br />
(b) To watch and protect the interest of brick kiln owners,<br />
Page 150 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
contractors, customers and brick dealers, members of<br />
the association and the interest of persons engaged in<br />
brick trade, commerce or industries legally, morally and<br />
socially.<br />
(c) To consider all questions connected with brick trade,<br />
commerce and industries and to initiate or support<br />
necessary action in connection therewith.<br />
(d) To protect the trade, with the co-operation of the<br />
Government through legislative representation to get the<br />
grievances and difficulties of Brick Kiln Association<br />
redressed.”<br />
139. The High Court took notice of the fact that the other<br />
objects appeared to be incidental to the paramount objects<br />
and were in the nature of powers to carry out the primary<br />
purpose. The association derived its income from the<br />
admission fee, membership subscription and rent realized by it<br />
from the building belonging to it. The association asserted that<br />
its income was entitled to exemption from tax under Section<br />
11(1)(a) of the I.T. Act, 1961 as it was formed for a charitable<br />
purpose, it objects being the advancement of general public<br />
utility. The ITO, however, disallowed the claim. The ITO took<br />
the view that as the assessment was confined to brick kiln<br />
owners, it could not be said to have been formed for the<br />
benefit of the general public and, therefore, was not entitled to<br />
exemption. On appeal, the AAC, relying on the main objects of<br />
the association, as laid down in the Memorandum of<br />
Association, held that the association was entitled to<br />
exemption. The AAC, relied on the decision of the Supreme<br />
Court in CIT vs. Andhra Chamber of Commerce (supra) and the<br />
decision of the Kerala High Court in CIT vs. Indian Chamber<br />
of Commerce, 1971 80 ITR 645. The AAC came to the<br />
conclusion that the association fulfilled the conditions as<br />
required under Section 11(1)(a) of the Act. The department<br />
Page 151 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
went up in appeal to the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal. It<br />
contended, on the basis of the decision of the Mysore High<br />
Court in CIT vs. Sole Trustee Loka Shikshana Trust, 1970<br />
77 ITR 61 and the decision of the Calcutta High Court in CIT<br />
vs. Indian Chamber of Commerce, 1971 81 ITR 147 that<br />
the conclusions of the AAC were erroneous. On the other<br />
hand, the respondent association relied on the decision of the<br />
Keral High Court in CIT vs. Cochin Chamber of Commerce<br />
&#038; Industry, 1973 87 ITR 83. It also contended that the<br />
decision of the Supreme Court in Andhra Chamber of<br />
Commerce, 1965 55 ITR 722, despite the fact that it pertained<br />
to the provisions of the Indian I.T. Act, 1922, was still good law<br />
as there was no change in the substantive provisions relating<br />
to the exemption of income from a trust in the I.T. Act, 1961.<br />
The Tribunal dismissed the appeal of the department. The<br />
department, being dissatisfied, preferred an appeal before the<br />
High Court. The High Court took notice of the fact that the<br />
Tribunal did not consider the matter relating to the dominant<br />
intention but construed the words “not involving the carrying<br />
on of any activity for profit” which had been added by the<br />
1961, Act to the definition of the term “charitable purpose”.<br />
The High Court also took notice of the fact that the Tribunal<br />
held that an activity for profit would imply that there should be<br />
a profit motive in the activities of the assessed. In other words,<br />
the activities should be commercial in nature. Further, the<br />
motive to make profit should be in the integrated activity of<br />
the buying and disposal. The High Court of Delhi, while<br />
dismissing the appeal of the department, held as under;<br />
“12. The question referred for our opinion is dependent<br />
on the construction and interpretation of &#8220;charitable<br />
purpose&#8221; as defined in s. 2(15) of the I. T. Act, 1961.<br />
Page 152 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
Section 2(15) reads :<br />
&#8220;&#8216;Charitable purpose&#8217; includes relief of the poor,<br />
education, medical relief, and the advancement of any<br />
other object of general public utility not involving the<br />
carrying on of any activity for profit.&#8221;<br />
13. It is well settled that the words &#8220;not involving the<br />
carrying on of any activity for profit&#8221; pertain only to the<br />
fourth limb of charitable purpose, i.e., the advancement<br />
of any other object of general public utility.<br />
14. However, there has been a conflict of opinion with<br />
regard to the meaning of these words. This conflict<br />
appears to have been set at rest in view of a recent<br />
decision of the Supreme Court in Addl. CIT v. Surat Art<br />
Silk Cloth Manufacturing Association [1980] 121 ITR 1.<br />
The assessed therein was a company incorporated under<br />
the Indian Companies Act, 1913, and registered under s.<br />
25 of the Companies Act, 1956; its objects were, inter<br />
alia, to promote commerce and trade, in art silk, raw silk,<br />
cotton yarn, art silk cloth, silk cloth and cotton and to<br />
carry on all and any business of art silk, etc., belonging to<br />
and on behalf of its members. The court held, inter alia,<br />
that where the main or primary objects are distributive,<br />
each and every one of the objects must be charitable in<br />
order that the trust or institution be upheld as a valid<br />
charity. But if the primary or dominant purpose of a trust<br />
or institution is charitable, another object, which by itself<br />
may not be charitable, but is merely ancillary or<br />
incidental to the primary or dominant purpose, would not<br />
prevent the trust or institution from being or valid charity.<br />
15. The fact that the members of the assessed benefited<br />
was merely incidental to the carrying out of the main or<br />
primary purpose and if the primary purpose was<br />
charitable, the subsidiary objects would not militate<br />
against its charitable character not would it make the<br />
purpose any the less charitable.<br />
16. The Supreme Court referring to its earlier decision in<br />
CIT v. Andhra Chamber of Commerce [1965] 55 ITR 722,<br />
observed that the court had held that the dominant or<br />
primary object of the Andhra Chamber of Commerce,<br />
which was to promote and protect trade, commerce and<br />
industry and to aid, stimulate and promote the<br />
development of trade, commerce and industry and to<br />
watch over and protect the general commercial interests<br />
of India or any part thereof was clearly an object of<br />
Page 153 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
general public utility. This was despite the fact that one<br />
of the objects included in the memorandum was the<br />
taking of steps to urge or oppose legislation affecting<br />
trade, commerce or manufacture, which by itself, might<br />
be considered non-charitable. However, as it was merely<br />
incidental to the dominant or primary object, it did not<br />
prevent the Andhra Chamber of Commerce from being a<br />
valid charity. Therefore, if the primary purpose was the<br />
advancement of an object of general public utility, it<br />
would remain charitable, even if an incidental entry into<br />
the political domain for achieving that purpose, such as<br />
promotion of or opposition to legislation concerning that<br />
purpose, was contemplated. Applying that very test, the<br />
Supreme Court held that the Surat Art Silk Cloth<br />
Manufacturers Association was also a valid charity.<br />
17. The true meaning of the ten words &#8220;not involving the<br />
carrying on of any activity for profit&#8221; was held to be, that<br />
when the purpose of a trust or institution is the<br />
advancement of an object of general public utility, it is<br />
that object of general public utility, and not its<br />
accomplishment or carrying out, which must not involve<br />
the carrying on of any activity for profit. So long as the<br />
purpose does not involve the carrying on of any activity<br />
for profit, the requirement of the definition would be met<br />
and it is immaterial how the monies for achieving or<br />
implementing such purpose are found, whether by<br />
carrying on an activity for profit or not. The decision of<br />
the Supreme Court in Indian Chamber of Commerce v.<br />
CIT [1975] 101 ITR 796 was overruled. It was observed<br />
that the decisions of the Kerala High Court in CIT v.<br />
Cochin Chamber of Commerce and Industry [1973] 87 ITR<br />
83 and the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Andhra Pradesh<br />
State Road Transport Corporation v. CIT [1975] 100 ITR<br />
392 laid down the correct interpretation.<br />
18. Applying these principles, it is clear that the dominant<br />
intention of the assessed was to promote the brick kiln<br />
trade. This purpose did not involve the carrying on of any<br />
activity for profit, though its advancement might have. It<br />
is thus a valid charity. For the relevant years, however, it<br />
appears that even the advancement of the purpose did<br />
not involve the carrying on of any activity for profit. The<br />
assessed is clearly entitled to the exemption under s.<br />
11(1)(a) of the Act. “<br />

Tax (Exemptions) &#038; Ors., Writ Petition (C) No.1872 of 2013,,<br />
decided on 22nd January, 2015, in context with Section<br />
10(23C)(iv) of the Act vis-a-vis Section 2(15) of the Act, had<br />
observed as under;<br />
“At this juncture, we may point out that we are in<br />
agreement with the argument advanced by Mr Syali that<br />
the proviso to Section 2(15) does not make any<br />
distinction between entities carrying on regular trade,<br />
commerce or business or providing services in relation to<br />
any trade, commerce or business on the one hand and<br />
genuine charitable organizations on the other. It must be<br />
remembered that we are construing the expression<br />
&#8220;charitable purpose&#8221; not in a vacuum, but in the specific<br />
context of Section 10(23C)(iv) of the said Act. As pointed<br />
out above, Section 10 deals with the incomes not<br />
included in total income. And, Section 10(23C)(iv)<br />
specifically deals with the income received by any person<br />
on behalf of, inter alia, an institution established for<br />
charitable purposes. We have to, therefore, examine the<br />
meaning of the expression &#8220;charitable purposes&#8221; in the<br />
context of Section 10(23C)(iv). Looking at the said<br />
expression from this stand point, it becomes clear that it<br />
has a reference to income. Because, it is only when such<br />
an institution has an income that the question of not<br />
including that income in its total income would arise.<br />
Therefore, merely because an institution, which<br />
otherwise is established for a charitable purpose,<br />
receives income would not make it any less a charitable<br />
institution. Whether that institution, which is established<br />
for charitable purposes, will get the exemption under<br />
Section 10(23C)(iv) would have to be determined by the<br />
prescribed authority having regard to the objects of the<br />
institution and its importance throughout India or<br />
throughout any State or States. There is no denying that<br />
having regard to the objects of the petitioner and its<br />
importance throughout India in the field of advancement<br />
of promotion of trade and commerce, the petitioner<br />
would be entitled to be regarded as an institution which<br />
would qualify for that exemption. The only thing that we<br />
have to examine is &#8211; whether the petitioner had been<br />
Page 155 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
established for charitable purposes? The fact that it<br />
derives income does not, in any way, detract from the<br />
position that it is an institution established for charitable<br />
purposes. Therefore, in our view, merely because the<br />
petitioner derives rental income, income out of sale of<br />
tickets and sale of publications or income out of leasing<br />
out food and beverages outlets in the exhibition grounds,<br />
does not, in any way, affect the nature of the petitioner<br />
as a charitable institution if it otherwise qualifies for such<br />
a character.<br />
We have already noted that prior to the amendment<br />
being introduced with effect from 01.04.2009, the<br />
petitioner had been recognized as an institution<br />
established for charitable purpose and this had been<br />
done having regard to the objects of the institution and<br />
its importance throughout India. It is only because of this<br />
that the petitioner had been granted the exemption by<br />
the respondent for the period prior to assessment year<br />
2009-10. Therefore, insofar as the receiving of income is<br />
concerned, that cannot be taken as an instance to deny<br />
the petitioner its status as an institution established for<br />
charitable purposes. Because, if that were to be so, then<br />
there would be no necessity to take recourse to Section<br />
10(23C)(iv) for the benefit of an exemption. To put it<br />
plainly, if an institution established for charitable<br />
purposes did not receive an income at all, then what<br />
would be the need for taking any benefit under Section<br />
10(23C)(iv) of the said Act. Therefore, if a meaning is<br />
given to the expression charitable ― purpose so as to<br />
suggest that in case an institution, having an objective of<br />
advancement of general public utility, derives an income,<br />
it would be falling within the exception carved out in the<br />
first proviso to Section 2(15) of the said Act, then there<br />
would be no institution whatsoever which would qualify<br />
for the exemption under Section 10(23C)(iv) of the said<br />
Act. And, the said provision would be rendered<br />
redundant. This is so, because, if the institution had no<br />
income, recourse to Section 10(23C)(iv) would not be<br />
necessary. And, if such an institution had an income, it<br />
would not, on the interpretation sought to be given by<br />
the revenue, be qualified for being considered as an<br />
institution established for charitable purposes. So, either<br />
way, the provisions of Section 10(23C)(iv) would not be<br />
available, either because it is not necessary or because it<br />
Page 156 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
is blocked. The intention behind introducing the proviso<br />
to Section 2(15) of the said Act could certainly not have<br />
been to render the provisions of Section 10(23C)(iv)<br />
redundant.<br />
With this in mind, it is to be seen as to what is meant by<br />
the expressions &#8220;trade&#8221;, &#8220;commerce&#8221; or &#8220;business&#8221;. The<br />
word &#8220;trade&#8221; was considered by the Supreme Court in its<br />
decision in the case of Khoday Distilleries Ltd and Others<br />
v. State of Karnataka and Others: 1995 (1) SCC 574,<br />
whereby the Supreme Court held that &#8220;the primary<br />
meaning of the word &#8216;trade&#8217; is the exchange of goods for<br />
goods or goods for money&#8221;. Furthermore, in State of<br />
Andhra Pradesh v. H. Abdul Bakhi and Bros: 1964 (5) STC<br />
644 (SC), the Supreme Court held that ―the word<br />
&#8220;business&#8221; was of indefinite import and in a taxing<br />
statute, it is used in the sense of an occupation, or<br />
profession which occupies time, attention or labour of a<br />
person, and is clearly associated with the object of<br />
making profit&#8221;. This court, in ICAI (I) (supra) held that,<br />
while construing the term &#8220;business&#8221; as appearing in the<br />
proviso to Section 2(15), the object and purpose of the<br />
Section has to be kept in mind. It was observed therein<br />
that a very broad and extended definition of the term<br />
&#8220;business&#8221; was not intended for the purpose of<br />
interpreting and applying the first proviso to Section<br />
2(15) of the Act so as to include any transaction for a<br />
cess, fee or consideration. The Court specifically held<br />
that:-<br />
―An activity would be considered &#8216;business&#8217; if it is<br />
undertaken with a profit motive, but in some cases, this<br />
may not be determinative. Normally, the profit motive<br />
test should be satisfied, but in a given case activity may<br />
be regarded as a business even when profit motive<br />
cannot be established / proved. In such cases, there<br />
should be evidence and material to show that the activity<br />
has continued on sound and recognized business<br />
principles and pursued with reasonable continuity. There<br />
should be facts and other circumstances which justify and<br />
show that the activity undertaken is in fact in the nature<br />
of business.”<br />
141. From the aforesaid decisions, it is apparent that merely<br />
because the Association puts up tickets of the international<br />
Page 157 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
cricket matches for sale and earns some profit out of the same,<br />
it would not lose its character of having been established for a<br />
charitable purpose. It is also important to note that we must<br />
examine as to what is the dominant activity of the institution in<br />
question. If the dominant activity of the institution was not<br />
business or trade or commerce, then any such incidental or<br />
ancillary activity would also not fall within the categories of the<br />
trade, commerce or business. It is clear from the facts of the<br />
present case that the driving force is not the desire to earn<br />
profit but the object is to promote the game of cricket and<br />
nurture the best of the talent.<br />
142. The Latin word utilis means ‘useful, beneficial, equitable,<br />
available’. Chambers Dictionary of English defines ‘utility’ as<br />
useful: power to satisfy the wants of people in general: a useful<br />
thing, public utility: public service or a Association providing<br />
such public service. According to ‘New Oxford Dictionary of<br />
English’ (1998), as a Noun, utility is the status of being useful,<br />
profitable or beneficial.<br />
143. The Corpus Juris Secundum Volume 73 page 990<br />
elucidates the following legal position.<br />
“A public utility” has been described as a business<br />
organization which regularly supplies the public with<br />
some commodity or service, such as electricity, gas,<br />
water, transportation or telephone or telegraph service.<br />
While the term has not been exactly defined, and, as has<br />
been said, it would be difficult to construct a definition<br />
that would fit every conceivable case, the distinguishing<br />
characteristic of a public utility is the devotion of private<br />
property by the owner or person in control thereof to<br />
such a use that the public generally, or that part of the<br />
public which has been served and has accepted the<br />
service, has the right to demand that the use or service, s<br />
Page 158 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
long as it is continued shall be conducted with reasonable<br />
efficiency and under proper charges. The term is<br />
sometimes used in an extended sense to include a great<br />
many matters of general welfare to the State and its<br />
communities. “<br />
144. The words ‘public utility’ or ‘general public utility’ are not<br />
capable of a precise meaning. The question whether service is<br />
public utility or not has to be discharged in the context of<br />
different situations but it is, as considered infra, well settled<br />
that public utility means public purpose depending upon the<br />
context in which it is used in the statute or the Rules. Indeed,<br />
in some decisions, public utility is considered very similar to<br />
one for public purpose (Hunter v A.G. 1909 AC 323, Babu<br />
Bankya Thakur v State of Bombay AIR 1960 SC 1203 and<br />
Jhandu Lal v State of Punjab AIR 1961 SC 343).<br />
145. In cases arising under the Income Tax Act, 1922 as well<br />
as 1961 Act, it is held that the expression ‘object of general<br />
public utility’ must be construed by applying the standard of<br />
customary law and common knowledge amongst the<br />
community to which the parties interested belong. This test,<br />
applied in the Trustees of the Tribune, seems to have<br />
influenced judicial thinking in the subsequent decisions as well.<br />
The object of general public utility would include all objects<br />
which promote the welfare of the general public even it<br />
includes taking up steps effecting trade, commerce or<br />
manufacture if the primary purpose is for advancement of<br />
objects of general public utility [Andhra Chamber of<br />
Commerce(supra)], even if in an insignificant manner the<br />
person makes some profit in carrying out the objects [Surat Art<br />
Silk (supra)]. In other words, any activity for the benefit of the<br />
Page 159 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
public or a section of the public, as distinguished from the<br />
benefit to an individual or a group of individuals, would be<br />
charitable purpose as the object is for advancement of general<br />
public utility. The expression includes all objects to promote<br />
the welfare of the public, and when an object is to promote or<br />
protect the interest of particular trade or industry that object<br />
becomes an object of public utility and would be charitable<br />
purpose (Gujarat Maritime Board (2007) 295 ITR 561 (SC) [see<br />
Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Agricultural Market<br />
Committee, (2011) 336 ITR 641 (AP)]<br />
146. In our opinion, this could be termed as a charitable<br />
purpose which has as its motive advancement of an object of<br />
general public utility to which the exception carved out in the<br />
first proviso to Section 2(15) of the Act would not apply.<br />
147. We may refer to and rely upon the decision of this Court<br />
in the case of Director of Income Tax (Exemption) vs.<br />
Sabarmati Ashram Gaushala Trust, reported in (2014) 44<br />
taxmann.com 141 (Gujarat), wherein this Court was called<br />
upon to consider whether the activities of the respondent<br />
assessee-Sabarmati Ashram Gaushala Trust could be termed<br />
as charitable having regard to the object with which the trust<br />
was constituted. We may quote the relevant observations;<br />
“What thus emerges from the statutory provisions, as<br />
explained in the speech of Finance Minister and the CBDT<br />
Circular, is that the activity of a trust would be<br />
excluded from the term ‘charitable purpose’ if it<br />
is engaged in any activity in the nature of trade,<br />
commerce or business or renders any service in relation<br />
to trade, commerce or business for a cess, fee and/or<br />
any other consideration. It is not aimed at<br />
excluding the genuine charitable trusts of general<br />
Page 160 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
public utility but is aimed at excluding activities in<br />
the nature of trade, commerce or business which are<br />
masked as ‘charitable purpose’.<br />
Many activities of genuine charitable purposes which are<br />
not in the nature of trade, commerce or business<br />
may still generate marketable products. After setting<br />
off of the cost, for production of such marketable<br />
products from the sale consideration, the activity may<br />
leave a surplus. The law does not expect the Trust<br />
to dispose of its produce at any consideration<br />
less than the market value. If there is any<br />
surplus generated at the end of the year, that<br />
by itself would not be the sole consideration for<br />
judging whether any activity is trade, commerce<br />
or business particularly if generating ‘surplus’ is wholly<br />
incidental to the principal activities of the trust;<br />
which is otherwise for general public utility, and<br />
therefore, of charitable nature.<br />
We are wholly in agreement with the view of<br />
the Tribunal. The objects of the Trust clearly establish<br />
that the same was for general public utility and where for<br />
charitable purposes. The main objectives of the trust are<br />
to breed the cattle and endeavour to improve the quality<br />
of the cows and oxen in view of the need of<br />
good oxen as India is prominent agricultural<br />
country; to produce and sale the cow milk; to<br />
hold and cultivate agricultural lands; to keep grazing<br />
lands for cattle keeping and breeding; to rehabilitate<br />
and assist Rabaris and Bharwads; to make<br />
necessary arrangements for getting informatics and<br />
scientific knowledge and to do scientific research with<br />
regard to keeping and breeding of the cattle,<br />
agriculture, use of milk and its various<br />
preparations, etc.; to establish other allied institutions<br />
like leather work and to recognize and help them in<br />
order to make the cow keeping economically<br />
viable; to publish study materials, books,<br />
periodicals, monthlies etc., in order to publicize the<br />
objects of the trust as also to open schools and hostels<br />
for imparting eduction in cow keeping and agriculture<br />
having regard to the trust objects.<br />
All these were the objects of the general public utility and<br />
would squarely fall under section 2 (15) of the Act. Profit<br />
Page 161 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
making was neither the aim nor object of the Trust.<br />
It was not the principal activity. Merely because<br />
while carrying out the activities for the purpose of<br />
achieving the objects of the Trust, certain incidental<br />
surpluses were generated, would not render the activity<br />
in the nature of trade, commerce or business. As clarified<br />
by the CBDT in its Circular No. 11/2008 dated 19 th<br />
December 2008 the proviso aims to attract those<br />
activities which are truly in the nature of trade,<br />
commerce or business but are carried out under the<br />
guise of activities in the nature of ‘public utility’. ”<br />
148. Carrying on an &#8216;activity in the nature of trade, commerce,<br />
or business&#8217; or rendering of any service in relation to trade etc.<br />
is sine qua non for taking away the character of charitable<br />
purpose. An activity in the nature of trade, commerce or<br />
business is always carried on with the prior object of earning<br />
income. What is relevant is the intention of the person before<br />
undertaking such activity. A line of distinction needs to be<br />
drawn between the activities undertaken by a society,<br />
otherwise satisfying the prescription .of section 2(15) &#8216;prior to<br />
the insertion of proviso, which are aimed at earning income<br />
divorced from the objects for which it is charitable por una<br />
parte and the activities which are aimed at the attainment of<br />
the objects for which It was set up por otra parte. Whereas the<br />
former fall within the mandate of the proviso to section 2(15),<br />
the latter do not. The obvious reason is that the latter activities<br />
are in furtherance of the charitable objects of such society and<br />
income, if any, resulting from such activities and does not<br />
convert the otherwise charitable activity [within the definition<br />
of section 2(15)] into carrying on of a business, trade or<br />
commerce. It can be understood with the help of a simple<br />
illustration. Supposing an association set up for the promotion<br />
of a particular trade, has its own premises‘ from which it<br />
carries out the activities for the promotion of such trade. If the<br />
Page 162 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
association lets out its premises from time to time for<br />
enhancing its income, which letting out has no relation with<br />
the objects for which it was set up as a charitable institution,<br />
namely, the promotion of that particular trade, the resultant<br />
activity will amount to carrying on trade, commerce or<br />
business so as to fall within proviso to section 2(15). 0n the<br />
other hand, if it uses its premises for undertaking activities for<br />
which it was set up and is a charitable institution, and while<br />
doing so, there results some income, such income will not<br />
amount to carrying on any trade, commerce or business. The<br />
crux of the matter is to understand the object of carrying on<br />
the activity which resulted into income. If the object is to<br />
simply earn income de hors the promotion of objects for which<br />
it was set up, it will fall within the ambit of proviso to section<br />
2(15) and if the object of the activity is to promote the objects<br />
for which it was set up, then it will not be caught within the<br />
sweep of the proviso notwithstanding the fact that there<br />
results some income from carrying out such activity. The core<br />
of the matter is to see whether the activity which resulted into<br />
some income or loss was carried on with the object of doing<br />
some trade, commerce or business, etc., or it was in<br />
furtherance of the objects (non-business) etc., for which the<br />
assessee was set up. In other words, the predominant object of<br />
the activities should be seen as to whether it is aimed at<br />
carrying on some business, trade or commerce or the<br />
furtherance of the object for which it was set up. If it falls in<br />
the first category, then, the case would be covered within the<br />
proviso to section 2(15) and, in the otherwise scenario, the<br />
assessee will be construed to have carried on its activities of<br />
general public utility. (see Society of Indian Automobile<br />
Manufactures vs. ITO, Delhi)<br />

149. The Delhi High Court in the Institute of Chartered<br />
Accounts of India v. Director General of Income-tax<br />
(Exemptions), 2013 358 lTR 91/217 Taxman 152/35<br />
taxmann.com 140 (Delhi) , observed, while disposing of a writ<br />
petition, that holding interviews for fees for the purpose of<br />
campus placements of its students does not amount to<br />
carrying on a business so as to deny exemption u/s 11 of the<br />
Act. It further observed that if the object or purpose of an<br />
institution is charitable, the fact that the institution collects<br />
certain charges does not alter the character of the institution.<br />
The Delhi High Court further observed in para 67 that “the<br />
purport of the first proviso to section 2(15) of the Act is not to<br />
exclude the entities which are essentially for charitable<br />
purpose, but are conducting some activities for a consideration<br />
or a fee. The object of introducing the first proviso is to<br />
exclude the organizations which are carrying on regular<br />
business from the scope of &#8220;charitable purpose'&#8221;. The High<br />
Court also noticed the purpose of introducing the proviso to<br />
section 2(15) of the Act from the Budget Speech of the Finance<br />
Minister while introducing the Finance Bill 2008 and<br />
reproduced the relevant extract to the Speech as under:&#8217;<br />
&#8220;…&#8230;..Charitable purpose&#8221; includes relief of the poor,<br />
education, medical relief and any other object of general<br />
public utility. These activities are tax exempt, as they<br />
should be. However, some entities carrying on regular<br />
trade, commerce or business or providing services in<br />
relation to any trade, commerce or business and earning<br />
incomes have sought to claim that their purposes would<br />
also fall under &#8220;charitable purpose&#8221;. Obviously, this was<br />
not the intention of Parliament and, hence, I propose to<br />
amend the law to exclude the aforesaid cases. Genuine<br />
charitable organizations will not in any way be affected.”<br />
The expressions &#8220;business&#8221;, &#8220;trade“ or “commerce&#8221; as<br />
Page 164 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
used in the first proviso must, thus, be interpreted<br />
restrictively and where the dominant object of an<br />
organization is charitable any incidental activity for<br />
furtherance of the object would not fall within the<br />
expressions &#8221; business&#8221;. &#8220;trade&#8221; or &#8220;commerce&#8221;.<br />
Question with regard to Section 11(1)(d) of the Act:<br />
150. So far as the question with regard to Section 11(1)(d) of<br />
the Act is concerned, we may only say that a charitable<br />
institution is entitled to exemption under Section 11 of the<br />
Income Tax Act. Such exemption is subject to the conditions<br />
prescribed therein. A reading of Section 11 shows that subject<br />
to the provisions of Sections 62 and 63 of the Act, the income<br />
enumerated therein shall not be included in the total income of<br />
the previous year of the person in receipt of the income. One<br />
of the source of income that is enumerated in clause (d) of<br />
sub-section (1) of Section 11 is the income in the form of<br />
voluntary contributions made with a specific direction that they<br />
shall form part of the corpus of the trust or institution. The fact<br />
that the donors had instructed that the interest earned shall be<br />
added to the corpus of the trust is not in dispute. If that be so,<br />
the interest earned on the contributions already made by the<br />
donors would also partake the character of income in the form<br />
of voluntary contributions made with a specific direction that<br />
they shall form part of the corpus of the trust. If that be so, the<br />
conclusion is irresistible that the Tribunal has rightly held that<br />
the interest earned would qualify for exemption under Section<br />
11(1)(d) of the Act.<br />
151. In the aforesaid context, the findings of the Tribunal are<br />
as under;<br />
“55. On a perusal of the BCCI Infrastructure Subsidy<br />
Page 165 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
rules, we find that what is given to the assessee as<br />
infrastructure subsidy is reimbursement of 50% of costs<br />
in respect of certain expenditure on infrastructure which<br />
is inherently in the capital field. The mere fact that it is<br />
not a reimbursement to an outside party, such as a<br />
district cricket association, does not really matter. As<br />
long as the subsidy is relatable to a capital asset created<br />
by the assessee on his own or by an eligible district<br />
cricket association, as the present subsidy undisputedly<br />
is, it is outside the ambit of revenue receipt and taxable<br />
income. The very foundation of the stand of the<br />
Assessing Officer is thus devoid of legally sustainable<br />
merits. As such, there can hardly be an occasion, in<br />
principle, to hold such a subsidy as a revenue receipt or<br />
taxable income. There is not even a whisper of a<br />
discussion by the Assessing officer to the effect that<br />
infrastructure subsidy is revenue in nature. As a matter<br />
of fact, the claim is made for the subsidy only after the<br />
expenditure having been incurred. The authorities below<br />
have simply brushed aside the case and the submissions<br />
of the assessee and proceeded to hold it as an income.<br />
Looking to the nature of the subsidy, which is clearly<br />
relatable to the capital assets generated, we are unable<br />
to hold this receipt in the revenue field. We, therefore,<br />
uphold the plea of the assessee on this point as well and<br />
delete the addition of Rs 2,13,34,033/-.”<br />
152. The Gujarat Cricket Association received corpus donation<br />
of Rs.20,69,60,338/- from the BCCI. The Assessing Officer held<br />
that it is not corpus donation and added the same to the<br />
income. Before the C.I.T (Appeals), the Association drew the<br />
attention to a letter addressed to the Officer dated 28th<br />
December, 2011 where two specific letters from the BCCI<br />
dated 12th October, .2001 and 13th October, 2001 respectively<br />
addressed to the Secretary of the Gujarat Cricket Association<br />
were produced. The letter dated 12th October, 2001 from the<br />
BCCI draws attention to the decision in the Annual General<br />
Meeting, and the resolution incorporating the said decision as<br />
follows<br />
Page 166 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
“5. Chairman suggested that as already decided in<br />
working Committee henceforth the TV subsidies should<br />
be sent towards &#8216;Corpus Fund&#8217; and this decision can also<br />
be approved by the members of this meeting. Thereafter<br />
the members unanimously approved that henceforth the<br />
TV subsidies should be sent by the Board to the Member<br />
Associations towards “Corpus Fund” instead of subsidy<br />
fund.”<br />
153. The C.I.T.(Appeals), in his order, in para-18 noted that the<br />
above “donation of Rs.1,38,36,800/- was treated as the Corpus<br />
donation in the A.Y. 2002-03.”. The aforesaid resolution<br />
mentioned in the letter of the BCCI dated 12th October, 2001,<br />
which used the word “henceforth”, which means in future also,<br />
was not considered good enough by him as “a specific<br />
direction” as required by section 11(1)(d) and only on that<br />
reasoning, he held that It Is not the corpus donation. The<br />
Department did not file appeal against the said decision but<br />
the Association did file an appeal to the Tribunal against the<br />
finding of absence of specific direction in every year. The<br />
Tribunal, on page 242, para-49 reproduced from their order in<br />
A.Ys. 2004-05 to 2007-08 pointing out that the “similar<br />
amounts received in the earlier years had been treated all<br />
along as the corpus donation”. ‘Earlier Year’ means A.Ys. 2002-<br />
03 and 2003-04. On page 245, the Tribunal reproduced para-<br />
15 of their order for the A.Ys. 2004-05 to 2007-08 as follows:<br />
&#8220;15. We find that, at pages 46 and 47 of the paperbook,<br />
the assessee has filed specific confirmations to the effect<br />
that these amounts were corpus donations. We have also<br />
perused the BCCI resolution no 5 dated 29th September<br />
2001 which specifically states that the TV subsidies<br />
should henceforth be sent to the Member Associations<br />
towards “corpus funds&#8221;. There is no dispute that the TV<br />
subsidy in question is sent under this resolution. On<br />
these facts, and In the light of the provisions of Section<br />
11(1)(d) which only require the income to be “by way of<br />
Page 167 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
voluntary contributions made with a specific direction<br />
that they shall form part of the corpus of the trust or the<br />
institution”, we are of the considered view that any<br />
payments made by the BCCI, without a legal obligation<br />
and with a specific direction that it shall be for corpus<br />
fund as admittedly the present receipt is, is required to<br />
be treated as corpus donation not includible in total<br />
income. We are unable to find any legal support for<br />
learned CIT(A)&#8217;s stand that each donation must be<br />
accompanied by a separate written document. The<br />
contribution has to be voluntary and it has to be with<br />
specific direction that it will form corpus of the trust’.<br />
These conditions are clearly satisfied. Any payment<br />
which the assessee is not under an obligation to make,<br />
whatever be the mode of its computation, is a voluntary<br />
payment, and, any payment which is with a specific<br />
direction that it for corpus fund is a corpus donation. In<br />
our considered view, even without the two specific<br />
confirmations filed by the assessee, in the light of the<br />
BCCI resolution under which the payment is made and in<br />
the light of the payment not being under any legal<br />
obligation, the conditions under section 11(1)(d) are<br />
satisfied. We, therefore, uphold the plea of the assessee.<br />
The Assessing Officer is accordingly directed to delete<br />
this addition of Rs.1,58,00,000.”<br />
154. In the course of the hearing of these tax appeals, the<br />
learned counsel appearing for the respective assessee also<br />
submitted that the promotion of sports and games would fall<br />
within the ambit of the term “education” so as to fall in the<br />
first limb of the definition of the term charitable purpose. In<br />
this regard, our attention was drawn to the Circular No.395<br />
dated 24th September, 1984 issued by the Central<br />
Government in its Finance Department. The circular reads<br />
thus;<br />
“CIRCULAR:NO.395 [F.NO.181(5)82/IT(A-I)-SECTION<br />
2(15) OF THE INCOME-TAX ACT, 1961-CHARITABLE<br />
PURPOSE-WHETHER PROMOTION OF SPORTS AND<br />
GAMES CAN BE CONSIDERED TO BE CHARITABLE<br />
Page 168 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
PURPOSE.<br />
SECTION 2(15) OF THE INCOME-TAX ACT, 1961-<br />
CHARITABLE PURPOSE-WHETHER PROMOTION OF<br />
SPORTS AND GAMES CAN BE CONSIDERED TO BE<br />
CHARITABLE PURPOSE<br />
Circular: No.395 [F.NO.181(5) 82/IT(A-I), DATED 24.9.1984.<br />
1. The expression “charitable purpose” is defined in<br />
section 2(15) to include relief of the poor, education,<br />
medical relief and the advancement of any other object<br />
of general public utility.<br />
2. The question whether promotion of sports and<br />
games can be considered as being a charitable purpose<br />
has been examined. The Board are advised that the<br />
advancement of any object beneficial to the public or<br />
section of the public as distinguished from an individual<br />
or group of individuals, would be an object of general<br />
public utility. In view thereof, promotion of sports and<br />
games is considered to be a charitable purpose within the<br />
meaning of section 2(15). Therefore, an association or<br />
institution engaged in the promotion of sports and games<br />
can claim exemption under section 11 of the Act, even if<br />
it is not approved under section 10(23) relating to<br />
exemption from tax of sports associations and institutions<br />
having their objects as the promotion, control, regulation<br />
and, encouragement of specified sports and games.”<br />
155. Mr. Bhatt raised a strong objection as regards the<br />
aforesaid issue. According to Mr. Bhatt, although the<br />
submission in this regard was canvassed before the ITAT, the<br />
ITAT thought fit not to touch the said issue for the reason<br />
assigned in para-41 of the impugned judgment. Para-41 reads<br />
thus;<br />
“We have noted that all the learned representatives have<br />
advanced detailed arguments on the proposition that<br />
since the assessee cricket associations are engaged in<br />
educational activities, it is not really material whether or<br />
not the assessee has engaged itself in the activities in<br />
Page 169 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
the nature of trade, commerce or business. However, in<br />
the light of our categorical finding that the assessee<br />
cricket associations were not really engaged in the<br />
activities in the nature of trade, commerce or business, it<br />
is not really necessary to adjudicate on this plea. We<br />
leave the question open for adjudication in a flt case.”<br />
156.. In such circumstances, referred to above, Mr. Bhatt, the<br />
learned senior counsel, submitted that this Court may not go<br />
into the issue whether the activities of the Association could be<br />
termed as imparting education in sports. In other words,<br />
imparting training in sports whether could be termed as an<br />
educational activity falling within the ambit of Section 2(15) of<br />
the Act. In this regard, the submission canvassed on behalf of<br />
the assessees is that imparting training in sports is nothing but<br />
an education activity and, therefore, the assessees would fall<br />
in the first limb of the definition of “charitable purpose” as<br />
defined under Section 2(15) of the Act and not under the<br />
residual clause of “advancement of any other object of general<br />
public utility”. The argument canvassed on behalf of the<br />
assessee is that if that be the situation, the Proviso to Section<br />
2(15) would not apply at all. At this stage, we deem it<br />
appropriate to quote Section 260A(6) of the Act, 1961 which<br />
reads thus;<br />
“The High Court may determine any issue which-<br />
(a) has not been determined by the Appellate Tribunal,<br />
or<br />
(b) has been wrongly determined by the Appellate<br />
Tribunal, by reason of a decision on such question of law<br />
as is referred to in sub-section(1).”<br />
157. The plain reading of the aforesaid provision indicates that<br />
the High Court may determine any issue which has not been<br />
Page 170 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
determined by the Appellate Tribunal.<br />
158. It is not in dispute that in none of the tax appeals, any<br />
substantial question of law as regards whether training in<br />
sports (game of cricket) would fall within the ambit of the term<br />
“education” so as to fall in the first limb of the definition of the<br />
term “charitable purpose” as defined under Section 2(15) of<br />
the Act. In the absence of any substantial question of law being<br />
formulated in this regard, whether we should go into this<br />
question and express any opinion of our own is something we<br />
should look into closely.<br />
159. Clause (a) of sub-section (6) to Section 260A of the Act<br />
states that the High Court may decide an issue, which is not<br />
determined by the Appellate Tribunal. The word “determined”<br />
means that the issue is not dealt with, though it was raised<br />
before the Tribunal. The word “determined” presupposes an<br />
issue was raised or argued but there is failure of the Tribunal<br />
to decide or adjudicate the same. In a given case, a substantial<br />
question of law may arise because of the facts and findings<br />
recorded by the Tribunal, but the said issue/question is not<br />
determined. In such cases, an appeal under Section 260A of<br />
the Act can be entertained. This would depend upon the facts<br />
of each case and the reasoning and findings recorded by the<br />
Tribunal.<br />
160. In the aforesaid context, we may refer to a decision of<br />
the Supreme Court in the case of M. Janardhana Rao vs.<br />
Joint Commissioner of Income Tax, 2005 (273) ITR 50,<br />
wherein the Supreme Court has observed as under;<br />
“Under Section 260A(2)(c) the appeal under Section 260A<br />
Page 171 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
shall be (a) in the form of a memorandum of appeal and<br />
(b) precisely stating therein the substantial question of<br />
law involved. Under Section 260A(3) when the High Court<br />
is satisfied that a substantial question of law is involved<br />
in any case it shall formulate that question and under<br />
section 260A(4) the appeal is to be heard only on the<br />
question formulated under the preceding sub- section. It<br />
has to be noted that in terms of Section 260A(4) the<br />
respondent in the appeal is allowed to argue at the time<br />
of hearing of the appeal that the case does not involve a<br />
substantial question of law as formulated. However,<br />
proviso to Section 260A(4) specifically lays down that<br />
nothing in Section 260A(4) shall be deemed to take away<br />
the power of the High Court to hear, for reasons to be<br />
recorded, the appeal on any other substantial question of<br />
law not formulated by it, in case it is satisfied that the<br />
case involves such question. Section 260A(5) provides<br />
that the High Court to decide the question of law as<br />
formulated and to deliver the judgment thereon<br />
containing grounds on which such decision is founded.<br />
Sub-section (6) empowers the High Court to determine<br />
any such issue which has not been determined by the<br />
Appellate Tribunal or has been wrongly determined by<br />
the Appellate Tribunal by reasons of a decision of such<br />
question of law as is referred to in sub-section (1) It is<br />
important to note that appeal to the High Court lies only<br />
when a substantial question of law is involved. It is<br />
essential for the High Court to first formulate question of<br />
law and thereafter proceed in the matter.<br />
Without insisting on the statement of substantial question<br />
of law in the memorandum of appeal and formulating the<br />
same at the time of admission, the High Court is not<br />
empowered to generally decide the appeal under Section<br />
260A without adhering to the procedure prescribed under<br />
Section 260A. Further, the High Court must make every<br />
effort to distinguish between a question of law and a<br />
substantial question of law. In exercise of powers under<br />
Section 260A, the findings of fact of the Tribunal cannot<br />
be disturbed. It has to be kept in mind that the right of<br />
appeal is neither a natural nor an inherent right attached<br />
to the litigation. Being a substantive statutory right, it has<br />
to be regulated in accordance with law in force at the<br />
relevant time. The conditions mentioned in Section 260A<br />
must be strictly fulfilled before an appeal can be<br />
Page 172 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
maintained under Section 260A. Such appeal cannot be<br />
decided on merely equitable grounds.<br />
An appeal under Section 260A can be only in respect of a<br />
`substantial question of law&#8217;. The expression `substantial<br />
question of law&#8217; has not been defined anywhere in the<br />
statute. But it has acquired a definite connotation<br />
through various judicial pronouncements. In Sir Chunilal<br />
V. Mehta &#038; Sons Ltd. v. Century Spinning &#038; Mfg. Co. Ltd.,<br />
AIR (1962) SC 1314, this court laid down the following<br />
tests to determine whether a substantial question of law<br />
is involved. The tests are: (1) whether directly or<br />
indirectly it affects substantial rights of the parties, or (2)<br />
the question is of general public importance, or (3)<br />
whether it is an open question in the sense that issue is<br />
not settled by pronouncement of this Court or Privy<br />
Council or by the Federal Court, or (4) the issue is not<br />
free from difficulty, and (5) it calls for a discussion for<br />
alternative view. There is no scope for interference by the<br />
High Court with a finding recorded when such finding<br />
could be treated to be a finding of fact.<br />
On reading of impugned judgment of the High Court it is<br />
clear that no substantial question of the law was<br />
formulated at the time of admission of the appeal.<br />
Obviously, the High Court has formulated questions<br />
subsequently after conclusion of arguments for the<br />
purpose of adjudication. That is clearly against the<br />
scheme of Section 260A. Additionally , grievance that<br />
certain points which were urged have not been dealt with<br />
by the High Court appears to be correct. “<br />
161. The aforesaid decision of the Supreme Court has been<br />
exhaustively discussed by a Division Bench of the Gauhati High<br />
Court in the case of Meghalaya Steels Ltd. &#038; Ors. vs.<br />
Commissioner of Income Tax, 2013 (358) ITR 551, wherein<br />
the following has been observed;<br />
“It follows, therefore, that the satisfaction of the High<br />
Court that the appeal involves substantial question of law<br />
is sine qua non for the appeal to be admitted for hearing.<br />
This position of law will not remain in doubt, when we<br />
proceed to minutely examine the provisions embodied in<br />
section 260A.<br />
Page 173 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
Sub-section (2) of section 260A permits the Chief<br />
Commissioner or Commissioner as well as an assessee,<br />
who may feel aggrieved by the order passed by an<br />
appellate Tribunal, to appeal to the High Court provided<br />
that the appeal is filed within one hundred and twenty<br />
days from the date on which the order, appealed against,<br />
is received by the assessee or the Chief Commissioner or<br />
the Commissioner, as the case may be. This apart, as<br />
indicated above, the appeal has to be in the form of<br />
memorandum of appeal precisely stating therein the<br />
substantial question or questions of law involved.<br />
Thus, apart from the period of limitation within which an<br />
appeal has to be preferred and the form in which the<br />
appeal has to be preferred, section 260A necessitates<br />
that the memorandum of appeal clearly states the<br />
substantial question or questions of law, which, according<br />
to the appellant, is, or are, involved in the appeal.<br />
Sub-section (3) of section 260A shows that when an<br />
appeal is filed, as prescribed by sub-section (2), stating<br />
the substantial question or questions of law involved, this<br />
would not, automatically, make the appeal admissible in<br />
law inasmuch as sub-sections (1) and (3) of section 260A<br />
make it clear that if an appeal, preferred under section<br />
260A, does not state the substantial question or<br />
questions of law involved, then, the appeal may not be<br />
admitted by the High Court.<br />
Coupled with the above, sub-section (3) of section 260A<br />
lays down that where the High Court is satisfied that a<br />
substantial question of law is involved in an appeal, it<br />
shall formulate that question. Conversely speaking, if the<br />
High Court finds, on examination of a memorandum of<br />
appeal, that the appeal does not give rise to a substantial<br />
question of law, the High Court is duty bound to dismiss<br />
the appeal in limine. If, however, the High Court takes<br />
the view that appeal has given rise to substantial<br />
question or questions of law, then, the High Court is<br />
under legal obligation to formulate the substantial<br />
question or questions of law, which, according to the<br />
High Court, the appeal has raised, and, then, the High<br />
Court shall hear the appeal on the question or questions<br />
so formulated.<br />
When an appeal is heard, in the light of sub-section (4) of<br />
section 260A on the substantial question or questions of<br />
law, which the court has formulated in the appeal, the<br />
Page 174 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
respondents shall be allowed to argue, at the time of<br />
hearing of the appeal, that no such substantial question<br />
or questions of law, as formulated by the High Court, has<br />
or have arisen for being answered in the appeal.<br />
What further follows from a close reading, as a whole, of<br />
section 260A is that if the High Court decides to give<br />
notice to a respondent, in an appeal, before formulating<br />
the substantial question or questions of law, the<br />
respondent, in the appeal, shall have the right to satisfy<br />
the<br />
High Court that the substantial question or questions of<br />
law, as contended by the appellant, is, or are, not really<br />
involved; or else, there would be no meaning and<br />
purpose in giving notice to the respondent, in the appeal,<br />
before the appeal is admitted by formulating the<br />
substantial question or questions of law on which, in the<br />
view of the High Court, the appeal needs to be heard.<br />
In other words, if a respondent, in appeal, made under<br />
section 260A, is given notice before admission of the<br />
appeal, it necessarily follows that the respondent has<br />
been given an opportunity by the High Court to satisfy<br />
the High Court that no substantial question or questions<br />
of law, as contended by the appellant, has or have arisen<br />
for determination and it would be thereafter that the<br />
High Court would take a decision whether the appeal has<br />
or has not given rise to any substantial question of law<br />
and if the High Court finds that the substantial question<br />
or questions of law has or have arisen, it shall admit the<br />
appeal by formulating, for hearing, such substantial<br />
question or questions of law, which, according to the<br />
High Court, the appeal has given rise to for adjudication<br />
and, then, answer the question or questions, so<br />
formulated, by according opportunity of hearing to the<br />
parties concerned on the substantial question or<br />
questions of law, which the High Court may have<br />
formulated.<br />
Logically extended, what the above scheme of hearing of<br />
the appeal conveys is that if the High Court, without<br />
admitting the appeal, chooses to issue, in a given appeal,<br />
notice to the respondent, in the appeal, to have the<br />
latter&#8217;s say in the matter, the parties to the appeal would<br />
have the right to address the court. Necessarily,<br />
therefore, at the stage of admission, in such a situation,<br />
while the appellant can address the court to show as to<br />
Page 175 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
how a substantial question of law or more than one<br />
substantial question of law can be said to have arisen, for<br />
determination, in the appeal, the respondent would have<br />
equally good right to try to satisfy the court on merit that<br />
the substantial question or questions of law, which the<br />
appellant contends to have arisen, has or have not<br />
arisen. If, thereafter, the High Court is satisfied that a<br />
substantial question or questions of law is, or are, indeed,<br />
involved, notwithstanding the submissions made to the<br />
contrary by the respondent, then, the High Court has to<br />
formulate the substantial question or questions of law on<br />
which, according to the High Court, the appeal needs to<br />
be heard and it is only on the substantial question or<br />
questions of law, so formulated, that hearing of the<br />
appeal would take place and, on this hearing, both the<br />
parties to the appeal would have the right to place their<br />
arguments.<br />
Obviously, while the appellant would try to show, at the<br />
time of hearing of the appeal, on its admission, that the<br />
substantial question or questions of law has or have<br />
arisen for determination and needs or need to be<br />
decided, the respondent would resist that substantial<br />
question of law (as suggested by the appellant and/or<br />
formulated by the High Court), does not really arise. In<br />
short, hearing of an appeal, under section 260A, can, in a<br />
given case, be in two different stages — once, before<br />
admission of the appeal, and, once again, after admission<br />
of the appeal.<br />
We may, however, hasten to add that there is no<br />
impediment, on the part of the High Court, to admit an<br />
appeal without giving notice to the respondent; but if the<br />
High Court decides to give a notice before admitting the<br />
appeal and if it decides to hear the respondent on the<br />
admission of the appeal, the High Court cannot straight<br />
away allow the appeal on the basis of the substantial<br />
question or questions of law, which the appellant may<br />
have formulated inasmuch as section 260A provides ‘that<br />
if the High Court finds that the appeal needs to be heard,<br />
the High Court is legally bound to formulate the<br />
substantial question or questions of law, which, according<br />
to the High Court, has or have arisen for determination.<br />
Put shortly, an appeal, under section 260A, can be heard<br />
subsequent to the formulation of the substantial question<br />
of questions of law, which, according to the High Court,<br />
has or have arisen for determination.<br />
Page 176 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
We may hastily add that the proviso to sub-section (4) of<br />
section 260A empowers the High Court to formulate any<br />
other substantial question of law if it is satisfied that the<br />
case involves such a question, though the appellant may<br />
not have raised such a substantial question of law.<br />
Sub-section (5) of section 260A makes it crystal clear<br />
that the appeal can be decided only on the substantial<br />
question of law, which has been formulated by the High<br />
Court, and not on the basis of the substantial question or<br />
questions of law, which the appellant may have<br />
mentioned in the memorandum of appeal, and the High<br />
Court has to deliver the judgment not on the substantial<br />
question or questions of law which an appellant may<br />
have framed, but only on that substantial question of law<br />
or those substantial questions of law, which the High<br />
Court has already formulated.<br />
It clearly follows, therefore, that no appeal can be heard,<br />
as already pointed out above, until the time the High<br />
Court is satisfied that the appeal involves a substantial<br />
question of law for determination and no appeal can be<br />
heard until the time the substantial question of law or<br />
questions of law, as the case may be, has or have been<br />
formulated by the High Court for the purpose of hearing<br />
of the appeal.<br />
Incidentally, one may also point out that the High Court,<br />
under section 260A(6), has the power to determine an<br />
issue, which has not been determined by an appellate<br />
Tribunal or has been wrongly determined by the<br />
appellate Tribunal.<br />
Sub-section (7) makes it further clear that the provisions,<br />
relating to second appeal, as embodied in section 100,<br />
CPC, shall, as far as may be, applied to the appeals under<br />
section 260A.<br />
The Supreme Court has pointed out, at para 11, in M.<br />
Janardana Rao v. Joint Commissioner of Incometax,<br />
(2005) 2 SCC 324, which Mr. Bhattacharjee, learned<br />
senior counsel, has relied upon, that under section<br />
260A(c), the appeal, under section 260A, shall be — (a)<br />
in the form of memorandum of appeal, and (b) the<br />
memorandum of appeal must precisely state the<br />
substantial question or questions of law involved and<br />
section 260A(3) lays down that when the High Court is<br />
satisfied that a substantial question of law is involved, in<br />
a given appeal, it shall formulate that question and the<br />
Page 177 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
appeal, in terms of the provisions of section 260A(4), has<br />
to be heard only on the question formulated by the High<br />
Court and that in terms of section 260A(4), the<br />
respondent, in appeal, has to be allowed to argue, at the<br />
time of hearing of the appeal, (wherein the substantial<br />
question or questions of law-stands or stand already<br />
formulated by the High Court), that the appeal does not<br />
involve a substantial question or questions of law as has<br />
been, or have been, formulated by the High Court.<br />
In M. Janardana Rao (supra), the Supreme Court has also<br />
clarified, at para 11, that the proviso to section 260A(4)<br />
lays down that nothing in section 260A(4) shall be<br />
deemed to take away the power of the High Court to<br />
hear, for reasons to be recorded, an appeal on any<br />
substantial question or questions of law not formulated<br />
by it provided that the High Court is satisfied that the<br />
case involves such a question. In no uncertain words, the<br />
Supreme Court has held, at para 11, in M. Janardana Rao<br />
(supra), that the High Court cannot, but decide the<br />
substantial question of law, as formulated by it under<br />
section 260A, and deliver judgment thereon containing<br />
the grounds on which its decision is founded. The<br />
observations, appearing at para 11, in’ M. Janardana Rao<br />
(supra), read as under:<br />
“11. Various essentials as culled out from the relevant<br />
provisions of the Act are as follows:<br />
Under section 260A(2)(c) the appeal under section 260A<br />
shall be (a) in the form of a memorandum of appeal, and<br />
(b) precisely stating therein the substantial question of<br />
law involved. Under section 260A(3) when the High Court<br />
is satisfied that a substantial question of law is involved<br />
in any case, it shall formulate that question and under<br />
section 260A(4) the appeal is to be heard only on the<br />
question formulated under the preceding sub-section. It<br />
has to be noted that in terms of section 260A(4) the<br />
respondent in the appeal is allowed to argue at the time<br />
of hearing of the appeal that the case does not involve a<br />
substantial question of law as formulated. However, the<br />
proviso to section 260A(4) specifically lays down that<br />
nothing in section 260A(4) shall be deemed to take away<br />
the power of the High Court to hear, for reasons to be<br />
recorded, the appeal on any other substantial question of<br />
law not formulated by it, in case it is satisfied that the<br />
case involves such question. Section 260A(5) provides<br />
Page 178 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
that the High Court is to decide the question of law as<br />
formulated and to deliver the judgment thereon<br />
containing grounds on which such decision is founded.”<br />
(Emphasis is added)<br />
Leaving none in doubt, the Supreme Court, in M.<br />
Janardana Rao (supra), has laid down the scope of<br />
section 260A by observing, in clear terms, that it is<br />
essential for the High Court to, first, formulate a<br />
substantial question of law and, thereafter, proceed in<br />
the matter.<br />
In other words, clarifying the scope of section 260A, the<br />
Supreme Court, in M. Janardana Iiao v. Joint<br />
Commissioner of Income-tax, (2005) 2 SCC 324, has<br />
pointed out, at para 13, thus:<br />
“13. It is important to note that the appeal to the High<br />
Court lies only when a substantial question of law is<br />
involved. It is essential for the High Court to first<br />
formulate a question of law and thereafter proceed in the<br />
matter.”<br />
(emphasis is added)<br />
The Supreme Court has pointed out, in M. Janardana Iiao<br />
(supra), that the conditions, mentioned in section 260A,<br />
must be strictly fulfilled before an appeal can be<br />
maintained under section 260A meaning thereby that if<br />
the appellant is unable to show that a substantial<br />
question of law has arisen for determination, there is no<br />
impediment, on the part of the High Court, to dismiss the<br />
appeal without even admitting the appeal. Logically<br />
extended, it would mean that if the respondent has been<br />
given notice before the High Court decides to admit an<br />
appeal, it would remain open to the respondent to show<br />
that no substantial question of law has arisen and in<br />
order to show that no substantial question of law has<br />
arisen, it would be, ordinarily, necessary for the<br />
respondent to make his submission on merit if the<br />
respondent seeks to satisfy the High Court that no<br />
substantial question of law for determination has arisen<br />
in the appeal. The relevant observations, appearing in<br />
this regard, in M. Janardana Iiao (supra), read as under:<br />
“14. Without insisting on the statement of substantial<br />
question of law in the memorandum of appeal and<br />
formulating the same at the time of admission, the High<br />
Court is not empowered to generally decide the appeal<br />
Page 179 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
under section 260A without adhering to the procedure<br />
prescribed under section 260A. Further, the High Court<br />
must make every effort to distinguish between a<br />
question of law and a substantial question of law. In<br />
exercise of powers under section 260A, the findings of<br />
fact of the Tribunal cannot be disturbed. It has to be kept<br />
in mind that the right of appeal is neither a natural nor<br />
an inherent right attached to the litigation. Being a<br />
substantive statutory right, it has to be regulated in<br />
accordance with law in force at the relevant time. The<br />
conditions mentioned in section 260A must be strictly<br />
fulfilled before an appeal can be maintained under<br />
section 260A. Such appeal cannot be decided on merely<br />
equitable grounds.”<br />
(emphasis is added)<br />
A three Judge Bench, in M. Janardana Rao (supra), culled<br />
out the test to determine as to what question can be<br />
treated as a substantial question of law. Having referred,<br />
in this regard, to the case of Sir Chunilal V. Mehta and<br />
Sons Ltd. v. Century Spg. and Mfg. Co. Ltd., (AIR 1962 SC<br />
1314), the Supreme Court has hold, at para 15, in M.<br />
Janardana Rao (supra), as under:<br />
“15. An appeal under section 260 A can only be in<br />
respect of a “substantial question of law”. The expression<br />
“substantial question oflaw” has not been defined<br />
anywhere in the statute. But it has acquired a definite<br />
connotation through various judicial pronouncements. In<br />
Sir Chunilal V. Mehta and Sons Ltd. v. Century Spg. and<br />
Mfg. Co. Ltd., this court laid down the following tests to<br />
determine whether a substantial question of law is<br />
involved. The tests are: (1) whether directly or indirectly<br />
it affects substantial rights of the parties, or (2) the<br />
question is of general public importance, or (3) whether it<br />
is an open question in the sense that the issue is not<br />
settled by pronouncement of this court or Privy Council<br />
or by the Federal Court, or (4) the issue is not free from<br />
difficulty, and (5) it calls for a discussion for alternative<br />
view. There is no scope for interference by the High Court<br />
with a finding recorded when such finding could be<br />
treated to be a finding of fact.”<br />
(emphasis is added)<br />
In M. Janardana Rao (supra), having found that the High<br />
Court had not formulated any substantial question of law<br />
at the time of admission of the appeal, but formulated,<br />
Page 180 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
for the purpose of adjudication of the appeal, the<br />
question subsequent to the conclusion of arguments, the<br />
Supreme Court took the view that the procedure, so<br />
adopted, is clearly against the scheme of section 260A.<br />
In the face of the facts, as indicated above, the Supreme<br />
Court, in M. Janardana Rao, (supra) interfered with the<br />
order, which had been passed, in appeal, by the High<br />
Court.<br />
In the case at hand, too, if this court finds, in the light of<br />
the clearly laid down position of law, in M. Janardana Rao<br />
(supra), that this court formulated the substantial<br />
question or questions of law for adjudication subsequent<br />
to the admission of the appeal, as is contended by the<br />
respondent-opposite party, then, such a breach by the<br />
High Court would make its judgment and order open to<br />
review if the power of review is, otherwise, found to be<br />
available to the High Court in a case of present nature.<br />
The relevant observations, appearing at para 1.6, in M.<br />
Janardana Rao (supra), read as under:<br />
“16. On reading of the impugned judgment of the High<br />
Court it is clear that no substantial question of law was<br />
formulated at the time of admission of the appeal.<br />
Obviously, the High Court has formulated questions<br />
subsequently after conclusion of arguments for the<br />
purpose of adjudication. That is clearly against the<br />
scheme of section 260A. Additionally, grievance that<br />
certain points which were urged have not been dealt with<br />
by the High Court appears to be correct.”<br />
(emphasis is added)<br />
Relying heavily on the case of Kanan (dead) by Lrs. v.<br />
V.S Pandurangam (dead) by Lrs., (2007) 15 SCC 157,<br />
Mr. Pathak, learned Additional Solicitor General, has<br />
submitted that the mere omission to frame substantial<br />
question of law before hearing of the appeal cannot be a<br />
reason for interfering with the impugned, judgement and<br />
order, dated 16.9.2010, unless prejudice is shown to<br />
have been caused.<br />
In Kanan (Dead) (supra), the Supreme Court has held<br />
that when the parties, in appeal, go to appeal knowing<br />
fully well the issue, the order, which is finally passed in<br />
the second appeal, cannot be interfered with unless<br />
prejudice is shown to have been caused as a result of<br />
omission to frame a substantial question of law.<br />
Page 181 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
While considering the case of Kanan (supra), it may be<br />
noted that, while the decision, in Kanan (supra), has been<br />
rendered by a two-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court,<br />
the decision, in M. Janardana Rao v. Joint<br />
Commissioner of Income-tax, (2005) 2 SCC 324, has<br />
been rendered by a three-Judge Bench of the Supreme<br />
Court. In M. Janardana Rao (supra), the Supreme Court<br />
has emphasized, at para 13, that it is essential for the<br />
High Court to, first, formulate a question of law and,<br />
thereafter, proceed with the matter and, at para 14, the<br />
Supreme Court has held, in M. Janardana Rao (supra),<br />
that the conditions, mentioned in section 260A, must be<br />
strictly fulfilled and that such an appeal cannot be<br />
decided merely on equitable grounds. In fact, in M.<br />
Janardana Rao (supra), the Supreme Court interfered<br />
with the order, made in the appeal under section 260A,<br />
on the ground that no substantial question of law had<br />
been framed at the time of the admission of the appeal<br />
and that the High Court had formulated, for the purpose<br />
of adjudication, the questions subsequent to the<br />
conclusion of the arguments, which procedure is against<br />
the scheme, which section 260A propounds.<br />
In the face of the decision, in M. Janardana Rao (supra),<br />
there can be no escape from the conclusion that disposal<br />
of an appeal without formulating the substantial<br />
questions of law and without hearing the parties, on such<br />
substantial questions of law, is illegal even if the High<br />
Court formulates the question, for the purpose of<br />
adjudication, subsequent to the conclusion of the<br />
arguments.<br />
The question, therefore, of prejudice having been caused<br />
or not does not arise. This apart, in the case at hand, it is<br />
the grievance of the review petitioners that as<br />
substantial questions of law had not been formulated for<br />
the purpose of hearing of the appeal, the review<br />
petitioners could not make their submissions on the merit<br />
of the substantial questions of law, which the High Court<br />
has, subsequent to the admission hearing, ultimately,<br />
decided inasmuch as one of the issues in the appeal has<br />
been decided against the review petitioners without<br />
according them an opportunity to have their say after<br />
making it clear to them that the substantial questions of<br />
law, which the memorandum of appeal had mentioned,<br />
were the substantial questions of law, which, even<br />
according to the High Court, had arisen for determination<br />
Page 182 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
and these were the questions, which would be finally<br />
taken up for adjudication by the court.<br />
Coupled with the above, the decisions, which have been<br />
referred to in Kanan (dead) by Lrs. v. VS.<br />
Pandurangam (dead) by Lrs., (2007) 15 SCC 157, are<br />
not on substantial questions of law, but on the question<br />
of issues. It is trite that even if an issue was not framed,<br />
it would not disable the court from refusing to interfere<br />
with a decree if the parties were, otherwise, well aware<br />
of the issues and if the omission to frame the issues has<br />
not caused any prejudice to either of the parties.<br />
In the face of the fact that no substantial question of law<br />
was formulated by the High Court before the appeal was<br />
heard for the purpose of disposal and this court had not<br />
made it clear to the parties, in the appeal, that the<br />
appeal would be disposed of on hearing the parties<br />
concerned at the admission stage itself, it logically<br />
follows that the decision, rendered in the appeal, was<br />
contrary to, and in violation of, the mandatory<br />
requirements as regards the procedure to be followed in<br />
an appeal under section 260A. Consequently, the<br />
impugned judgment and order, dated 16.9.2010, cannot<br />
survive.”<br />
162. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we are not going into<br />
the question whether the assessees could be said to be<br />
engaged in imparting education in the form of promoting the<br />
game of cricket.<br />
163. We sum up our final conclusions as under;<br />
(i) In carrying on the charitable activities, certain surplus<br />
may ensue. However, earning of surplus, itself, should not be<br />
construed as if the assessee existed for profit. The word<br />
“profit” means that the owners of the entity have a right to<br />
withdraw the surplus for any purpose including the personal<br />
purpose.<br />
(ii) It is not in dispute that the three Associations have not<br />
Page 183 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
distributed any profits outside the organization. The profits, if<br />
any, are ploughed back into the very activities of promotion<br />
and development of the sport of cricket and, therefore, the<br />
assessees cannot be termed to be carrying out commercial<br />
activities in the nature of trade, commerce or business.<br />
(iii) It is not correct to say that as the assessees received<br />
share of income from the BCCI, their activities could be said to<br />
be the activities of the BCCI. Undoubtedly, the activities of the<br />
BCCI are commercial in nature. The activities of the BCCI is in<br />
the form of exhibition of sports and earn profit out of it.<br />
However, if the Associations host any international match once<br />
in a year or two at the behest of the BCCI, then the income of<br />
the Associations from the sale of tickets etc., in such<br />
circumstances, would not portray the character of commercial<br />
nature.<br />
(iv) The State Cricket Associations and the BCCI are distinct<br />
taxable units and must be treated as such. It would not be<br />
correct to say that a member body can be held liable for<br />
taxation on account of the activities of the apex body.<br />
(v) Irrespective of the nature of the activities of the BCCI<br />
(commercial or charitable), what is pertinent for the purpose of<br />
determining the nature of the activities of the assessees, is the<br />
object and the activities of the assessees and not that of the<br />
BCCI. The nature of the activities of the assessee cannot take<br />
its colour from the nature of the activities of the donor.<br />
Discussion of case law:<br />
164. We shall now proceed to deal with the decisions, upon<br />
which, strong reliance has been placed on behalf of the<br />
Page 184 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
Revenue.<br />
165. In the case of Truck Operators Association (supra), the<br />
assessee Truck Operators Association had filed an application<br />
in Form No.10A for registration of the Society under Section<br />
12AA of the Act along with the certificate of registration<br />
granted by the Registrar of Societies and a copy of<br />
Memorandum and By-Laws of the Society. The Commissioner<br />
rejected the application holding that the Association was not<br />
formed for advancement of object of general public utility<br />
within the meaning of Section 2(15) of the Act. The Tribunal<br />
allowed the assessee&#8217;s appeal and directed the Commissioner<br />
to grant the registration under Section12AA to the assessee-<br />
Society. The Revenue went in appeal before the High Court of<br />
Punjab &#038; Haryana. The High Court thought fit to allow the<br />
appeal, observing as under;<br />
“9. On examination of the objects and the purpose of the<br />
Association in the present case, it emerges that the<br />
respondent-Association is union of Truck Operators<br />
constituted for facilitating its members to carry on the<br />
trade of transportation and not to allow the outsider or<br />
non-member to undertake any business activity within<br />
the precincts of Hansi Town/village. The Association<br />
charges fees from its members before the transportation<br />
on the basis of the distance involved. The membership<br />
and payment of fees are mandatory and the element of<br />
voluntary contribution is missing. The association is<br />
vigorously pursuing transportation business by receiving<br />
freight charges on behalf of its members. The welfare<br />
activities adopted for the truck drivers, cleaners and<br />
mechanics of the truck owners are in the nature of staff<br />
welfare activities, as are common in other business<br />
organizations which cannot be termed for general public<br />
utility.<br />
17. The assessee was a union of transport operators<br />
registered as a Trade Union under the Indian Trade<br />
Page 185 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
Unions Act, 1926. On analysis of the objects of the<br />
union for which it was constituted, it was discerned that<br />
the surplus funds of the trade union could be distributed<br />
among the members at the time of its dissolution. In<br />
other words, it was held that the rules and regulations do<br />
not impose a legal obligation on the assessee or its<br />
members to hold the income of the assessee only for<br />
charitable purposes and the element of private gain<br />
could not be excluded. The union was, thus, held not to<br />
be a Charitable Institution.”<br />
166. Thus, on the facts of that case, the High Court took the<br />
view that the assessee was not carrying on the activities for<br />
charitable purposes and, therefore, was not entitled to the<br />
benefit of registration under Section 12AA of the Act. One<br />
important aspect which was noticed by the High Court was that<br />
the surplus funds of the Trade Union could be distributed<br />
among the members at the time of its dissolution. The High<br />
Court noticed that the rules and regulations did not impose a<br />
legal obligation on the assessee or its members to hold the<br />
income of the assessee only for charitable purposes and the<br />
element of private gain could not be excluded. This decision,<br />
in our opinion, is of no avail to the Revenue.<br />
167. In National Institute of Aeronautical Engg. Educational<br />
Society (supra), the assessee was an educational society. It<br />
moved an application before the Commissioner for grant of<br />
registration under Section12AA of the Act. The Commissioner,<br />
after examining the record before him, concluded that the<br />
assessee was not carrying any charitable activity within the<br />
meaning of Section 2(15) as it was charging substantial fees<br />
from the students and making huge profits from that business.<br />
Consequently, the assessee&#8217;s application was rejected. The<br />
Tribunal, however, allowed the appeal of the assessee. The<br />
Revenue went in appeal before the High Court of Uttarakhand.<br />
Page 186 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
The High Court, while allowing the appeal preferred by the<br />
Revenue, observed as under;<br />
“10. Section 12AA of the Act provides the procedure for<br />
registration. Clause (a) of sub Section (1) of Section 12AA<br />
empowers the CIT to call for such documents or<br />
information from the trust or institution as he thinks<br />
necessary in order to satisfy himself about the<br />
genuineness of the activities of the trust or institution<br />
and may also make such inquiries, as he may deem<br />
necessary in this behalf. Said provision in Section 12AA<br />
makes it clear that CIT is not supposed to allow<br />
registration with blind eyes. In the present case, CIT has<br />
considered the relevant papers before him, which<br />
included the income and expenditure accounts of the<br />
previous years after the society got registered with the<br />
Assistant Registrar Firms, Societies and Chits. The CIT,<br />
after considering the record before him, has observed<br />
that the society (present respondent) is charging<br />
substantial fees from the students and making huge<br />
profits.<br />
11. After considering the submissions of the learned<br />
Counsel for the parties, we are of the view that mere<br />
imparting education for primary purpose of earning<br />
profits cannot be said to be a charitable activity. We are<br />
of the firm view that, in the expression &#8216;charitable<br />
purpose&#8217;, &#8216;charity&#8217; is the soul of the expression. Mere<br />
trade or commerce in the name of education cannot be<br />
said to be a charitable purpose. And Commissioner<br />
Income Tax has to satisfy itself as provided under Section<br />
12AA of the Act before allowing the registration. Question<br />
of law stands answered. “<br />
168. Thus, in the aforesaid case, the High Court took the view<br />
that as the Society was charging substantial fees from the<br />
students and making huge profits, it could not be said that the<br />
assessee was carrying on any charitable activity. This decision<br />
also is of no avail to the Revenue.<br />
Page 187 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
169. In Hyderabad Race Club (supra), the assessee was a<br />
Society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860<br />
and the objects, for which, the assessee was established were<br />
specified in Para No.3 of the Memorandum of Association. The<br />
objects were to encourage, promote the scientific breeding<br />
and training of horses, ponies and mules and to carry on the<br />
business of a race club in all its branches etc. The ITO rejected<br />
the assessee&#8217;s claim that it was a charitable institution and<br />
that its income was exempt under Section 11 on the ground<br />
that the assessee was carrying on a business by conducting<br />
races which was an activity for profit. On appeal by the<br />
assessee, the Tribunal upheld the ITO&#8217;s order. The matter was<br />
ultimately heard by a Full Bench of the High Court of Andhra<br />
Pradesh. While answering the substantial question of law in<br />
favour of the Revenue and against the assessee, the Full<br />
Bench observed as under;<br />
“9. It would thus be seen that the scientific breeding and<br />
training of horses and the imparting of instructions<br />
relating to horse breeding in all its aspects, is shown as<br />
an incidental or ancillary object in the memorandum of<br />
association of the assessee-company which was<br />
established in April 1971. Learned counsel submits that<br />
in the memorandum of association constituting the<br />
assessee as a company in April, 1971, carrying on the<br />
business of a race club in all its branches had to be<br />
specified as the main object in order to meet the<br />
requirements of the company law, although in point of<br />
fact the main object for which the assessee-company was<br />
established, was what was stated as an incidental or<br />
ancillary object against sl. no. 4 referred to above. It is<br />
pointed out that for the purpose of incorporating a<br />
company, the business which the company carries on has<br />
to be specified as the main object and all other objects<br />
have to be specified as incidental or ancillary objects,<br />
and this classification for the limited purpose of the<br />
Companies Act should not, according to the learned<br />
counsel, be confused with the real object for which the<br />
Page 188 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
assessee-company was established. According to the<br />
learned counsel, the basic or dominant object for which<br />
the assessee was established, whether as a society prior<br />
to April, 1971, or as a company from April, 1971, was to<br />
encourage and promote the scientific breeding and<br />
training of horses and to impart instructions in and to<br />
diffuse useful and scientific knowledge of horse breeding<br />
and to encourage horse breeding in all its aspects which,<br />
according to the learned counsel, are objects of general<br />
public utility. The other objects specified, whether in the<br />
memorandum of association relating to the assessee as a<br />
society or in the memorandum of association relating to<br />
the assessee as a company, are all subservient to the<br />
main object of &#8220;scientific horse breeding&#8221;. Consequently,<br />
the doctrine of dominant or primary object should be<br />
invoked in the present case in order to examine whether<br />
the dominant or primary object for which the assessee is<br />
established, is charitable in character.<br />
10. We are unable to agree with the learned counsel<br />
that the dominant or primary object for which the<br />
assessee is established either as a society or as a<br />
company, is the scientific breeding of horses, and not for<br />
the purpose of carrying on business in conducting races.<br />
Referring to the memorandum of association of the<br />
assessee as a society under the Societies Registration<br />
Act, we see no ground to regard the object specified in<br />
clause (c) of para 3 as a power conferred on the society<br />
to carry on the business to advance and promote the socalled<br />
main object of scientific breeding and training of<br />
horses. In the first place, paragraph 3 specifically<br />
mention that carrying on the business of a race club is an<br />
object for which the society is established. It is not in the<br />
nature of a power conferred on the society. It is true that<br />
some of the objects specified in para 3 of the<br />
memorandum of association relate to powers conferred<br />
on the society and there is, to some extent, a mix-up of<br />
the objects and powers in pars. 3. We have, however, no<br />
difficulty in regarding the carrying on of the business by<br />
conducting races as being in the nature of an objects<br />
rather than a power. If any doubt in the above regard<br />
subsists as regards the memorandum of association of<br />
the society, that is clearly set at rest while setting out the<br />
objects for which the assessee was established as a<br />
company. As we have already referred to above, the<br />
memorandum of association of the assessee after its<br />
Page 189 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
incorporation in April, 1971, as a company clearly states<br />
that the main object to be pursued by the assesseecompany<br />
on its incorporation, is to carry on the business<br />
of a race club in all its branches. Even when the assessee<br />
was a society, carrying on the business of a race club<br />
was obviously the main object although it was mixed up<br />
with other objects, as there was no statutory requirement<br />
that the main objects and ancillary objects should be<br />
separately specified in the case of society. We are unable<br />
to appreciate the learned counsel&#8217;s contention that<br />
notwithstanding the memorandum of association<br />
specifying the carrying on of the business of a race club<br />
as the main object for which the assessee-company was<br />
incorporated, we should hold that the main object for the<br />
purpose of the Companies Act is the carrying on of the<br />
business of a race club, and the main object for the<br />
purpose of the I.T. Act is the scientific breeding of horses.<br />
We must reject the contention that the main objects for<br />
which the assessee was established should be regarded<br />
differently for the purpose of the companies Act and the<br />
I.T. Act. The provision contained in the memorandum of<br />
association is unlearned counsel. We have, therefore, no<br />
difficulty in coming to the conclusion that the main object<br />
for which the assessee was established whether as a<br />
society or as a company, was to carry on the business of<br />
a race club and all other objects are either incidental or<br />
ancillary to the above main object. Thus, even invoking<br />
the doctrine of dominant or primary object, we must hold<br />
that the assessee was established with the dominant or<br />
primary object of carrying on the business of a race club<br />
by conducting a races which, on the own admission of<br />
the learned counsel, is not charitable in character. This<br />
itself is sufficient to demolish the assessee&#8217;s claim that it<br />
must be regarded as having been established for<br />
charitable purposes by invoking the doctrine of dominant<br />
or primary object.”<br />
170. Thus, on the facts of that case, the Full Bench, ultimately,<br />
held that the assessee was established with the dominant or<br />
primary object of carrying on the business of a race club by<br />
conducting races which cannot be termed as charitable in<br />
character. This decision also is of no avail to the Revenue in<br />
Page 190 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
the case at hand.<br />
171. In Dharmaposhanam Co. (supra), the objects of the<br />
assessee Company were to raise funds by conducting kuries<br />
with Company as foreman, receiving donations and<br />
subscriptions by lending money on interest and by such other<br />
means as the Company would deem fit to do the needful for<br />
the promotion of charity, industries etc. The appellant derived<br />
income from the property, money lending and business in<br />
kuries or chit funds held under the trust and claimed<br />
exemption from tax in respect of the said income under<br />
Section 11. The Tribunal held that the assessee was not<br />
entitled to exemption. The matter went right upto the Supreme<br />
Court. The Supreme Court, while dismissing the appeal of the<br />
assessee, observed as under;<br />
“On a consideration of the rival contentions of the<br />
parties, the position appears to be this. The appellant can<br />
succeed in his claim to exemption under section 1 1 (1)(a)<br />
of the Act if the income from the business of conducting<br />
kuries and of money lending can be said to be income<br />
derived from property held under trust wholly for<br />
charitable purposes. It is well settled that business is<br />
&#8220;property&#8221; within the meaning of section 11(1)(e). C.I.T.<br />
v. Krishna Warrier, (1964) 53 ITR 176 (SC). That is also<br />
evident from the provisions of section 11 (4), and<br />
reference may be made also to section 13(1)(bb).<br />
Further, it is apparent from the terms of the<br />
Memorandum of Association and the Articles of<br />
Association that the business of conducting kuries and of<br />
money lending is held under trust. The question is : Is the<br />
business held under trust for charitable purposes ?<br />
There can be little doubt that when sub-clause (a) of<br />
clause 3 of the Memorandum says &#8220;To raise funds by<br />
conducting kuries, with company as foreman, receiving<br />
donations and subscriptions by lending money on<br />
interest and by such other means as the company deem<br />
fit&#8221;. it refers to powers conferred on the appellant to raise<br />
Page 191 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
money in aid of, and for the purpose of accomplishing,<br />
the objects mentioned in sub-clause (b) of clause 3 of the<br />
Memorandum. Upto June 6, 1965 sub-clause (b) read :<br />
&#8220;To do the needful for the promotion of charity,<br />
education, industries, etc. and public good&#8221;.<br />
Can all the purposes mentioned in sub-clause (b) be<br />
described as charitable purposes ? Section 2(15) of the<br />
Act defines the expression &#8220;charitable purpose&#8221; as<br />
including &#8220;relief of the poor, education, medical relief and<br />
the advancement of any other object of general public<br />
utility not involving the carrying on of any activity for<br />
profit.&#8221; Two objects in sub-clause (b) of clause (3) of the<br />
Memorandum need to be considered, &#8220;industries&#8221; and<br />
&#8220;public good&#8221;. As regards the latter, the decision on what<br />
should be the &#8220;purposes of common good&#8221; was left to the<br />
general meeting by Article 58 of the Articles of<br />
Association. Having regard to the context in which these<br />
words appear in the Memorandum and the Articles, they<br />
must evidently be referred to the residue general head in<br />
the definition in section 2(15) of the Act, that is to say,<br />
&#8220;the advancement of any other object of general public<br />
utility&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; But this head is qualified by the restrictive<br />
words &#8220;not involving the carrying on of any activity for<br />
profit.&#8221; The operation of an industry ordinarily envisages<br />
a profit making activity, and so far as the advancement<br />
of public good is concerned, it is open to the appellant to<br />
pursue a profit making activity in the course of carrying<br />
out that purpose, which of course depends on the nature<br />
and purpose of the &#8220;public good. Nowhere do we find in<br />
the material before us any limiting provision that if the<br />
appellant carries on any activity in the course of actually<br />
carrying out those purposes of the trust it should refrain<br />
from adopting and pursuing a profit making activity. In<br />
Sole Trustee, Loka Shikshana Trust v. Commissioner of<br />
Income-Tax, Mysore, (1975) 101 ITR 234, 243 (SC),<br />
Khanna and Gupta, JJ., dealing with a case in which the<br />
assessee carried on a business in the course of the actual<br />
carrying out of a primary purpose of the trust, rejected<br />
the claim to exemption and declared :-<br />
&#8220;The fact that the appellant trust is engaged in the<br />
business of printing and publication of newspaper and<br />
journals and the further fact that the aforesaid activity<br />
yields or is one likely to yield profit and there are no<br />
restrictions on the appellant-trust earning profits in the<br />
Page 192 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
course of its business would go to show that the purpose<br />
of the appellant- trust does not satisfy the requirement<br />
that it should be one &#8216;not involving the carrying on of any<br />
activity for profit&#8230;&#8230;.. Ordinarily profit is a normal<br />
incident of business activity and if the activity of a trust<br />
consists of carrying on of a business and there are no<br />
restrictions on its making profit, the Court would be well<br />
justified in assuming in the absence of some indication to<br />
the contrary that the object of the trust involves the<br />
carrying on of an activity for profit.&#8221;<br />
Beg, J., in the same case, observed<br />
&#8220;The deed puts no condition upon the conduct of the<br />
newspaper and publishing business from which we could<br />
infer that it was to be on &#8220;no profit and no loss&#8221; basis &#8230;.<br />
That character (i.e. of the deed) is determined far more<br />
certainly and convincingly by the absence of terms which<br />
could eliminate or prevent profit making from becoming<br />
the real or dominant purpose of the trust. It is what the<br />
provisions of the trust make possible or permit coupled<br />
with what had been actually done without any illegality in<br />
the ;Nay of profit making, in the case before us, under<br />
the cover of the provisions of the deed, which enable us<br />
to decipher the predominantly profit making character of<br />
the trust.&#8221;<br />
In a subsequent case, Commissioner of Income-Tax,<br />
Kerala v. Cochin Chamber of Commerce and Industry,<br />
(1975) 101 ITR 796 (SC), this Court extended the test to<br />
income derived from activities carried on in aid of, and<br />
incidental to, the primary object of the trust. We may<br />
note that no attempt has been made by the appellant<br />
before us to cast doubt on the validity of the<br />
observations made in those two cases, and we proceed<br />
on the footing that they convey the true content of the<br />
law.<br />
It is, therefore, apparent that among the objects<br />
contained in the original unamended sub-clause (b) of<br />
clause (3) of the Memorandum are objects which, while<br />
referable to the residual general head in the definition of<br />
&#8220;charitable purpose&#8221; in section 2(15) of the Act,<br />
nonetheless do not satisfy the condition that they should<br />
not involve &#8220;the carrying on of any activity for profit.&#8221; The<br />
result is that the objects &#8220;industries&#8221; and &#8220;common good&#8221;<br />
Page 193 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
cannot be described as &#8220;charitable purposes&#8221;. What<br />
follows then is this, that the said sub-clause (b) can be<br />
said to contain some objects which are charitable and<br />
others which are non- charitable. They are all objects<br />
which appear to enjoy an equal status. It is open to the<br />
appellant, in its discretion, to apply the income derived<br />
from conducting kuries and from money lending, to any<br />
of the objects. No definite part of the business or of its<br />
income is related to charitable purposes only.<br />
Consequently, in view of Mohammed Ibrahim Raza v.<br />
Commissioner of Income-&#8216;Tax, (1930) LR 57 IA 260; AIR<br />
1930 PC 226 and East India Industries (Madras) Private<br />
Limited v. Commissioner of Income-Tax, (1967) 65 ITR<br />
611 (SC), , the entire claim to exemption must fail and it<br />
cannot be said that any part of the income under<br />
consideration is exempt from tax. That is the position in<br />
regard to the assessment years 1962-63 to 1965-66<br />
before us”<br />
172. Thus, in the facts of that case, the Supreme Court,<br />
ultimately, held that the objects “industries” and “common<br />
good” could not be described as “charitable purposes”. This<br />
decision also, in our opinion, is of no avail to the Revenue.<br />
173. In the case of Sole Trustee Loka Shikshana Trust (supra),<br />
the appellant was the sole trusty of a trust. The object of the<br />
trust was to educate the people of India in general and of<br />
Karnataka in particular by (a) establishing, conducting and<br />
helping directly or indirectly institutions calculated to educate<br />
the people by spread of knowledge on all matters of general<br />
interest and welfare; (b) founding and running reading rooms<br />
and libraries and keeping and conducting printing houses and<br />
publishing or aiding the publication of books, booklets, leaflets,<br />
pamphlets, magazines etc., in Kannada and other languages,<br />
all these activities being started, conducted and carried on<br />
with the object of educating the people; (c) supplying the<br />
Page 194 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
Kannada speaking people with an organ or organs of educated<br />
public opinion and conducting journals in Kannada and other<br />
language for the dissemination of useful news and information<br />
and for the ventilation of public opinion on matters of general<br />
public utility; and (d) helping directly or indirectly societies and<br />
institutions which have all or any of the aforesaid objects in<br />
view. The High Court held that the income of the trust was not<br />
entitled to exemption under Section 11 read with Section 2(15)<br />
of the Act. The assessee, went in appeal before the Supreme<br />
Court. The Supreme Court, while dismissing the appeal of the<br />
assessee, observed as under;<br />
“In addition to the power which the sole trustee had to<br />
collect donations and subscriptions for the trust. he had<br />
all the powers which the sole manager of a business may<br />
have in order to carry it on profitably. He had the power<br />
of transferring trust properties and funds if he thought &#8220;it<br />
expedient in the interest of the objects of the Trust, to<br />
transfer the assests and liabilities of this Trust to any<br />
other Charitable Trust or institution conducted by such<br />
Trust which in the opinion of the original Trustee or the<br />
Board of Trustee has objects similar to the objects of this<br />
Trust and is capable of carrying out the objects and<br />
purposes of this Trust either fully or partially&#8221; (Paragraph<br />
17 of the Trust deed). Although, the &#8220;original trustee&#8221;<br />
was not &#8220;to take any remuneration&#8221; for discharging his<br />
duties as a trustee, yet, he was not precluded &#8220;from<br />
being paid out of the Trust fund such remuneration as<br />
may be deemed propellor carrying out any work and duty<br />
in connection with the conduct or management of<br />
institutions of the Trust, or with the business of printing,<br />
publishing or other activities carried on by the Trust&#8221;. He<br />
was to be paid expenses incurred in travelling or<br />
otherwise in connection with his duties as a trustee<br />
(paragraph 16 of the Trust deed).<br />
The &#8220;original trustee&#8221; could invest trust monies and profits &#8220;in any<br />
investment authorised by law for the investment of Trust funds or in<br />
shares, or securities or debentures of Limited Companies in India or<br />
outside&#8221; (para 4 of the Trust deed). He had the &#8220;power to mortgage,<br />
sell, transfer and give on lease or to otherwise deal with the Trust<br />
Page 195 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
property or any portion thereof for the purpose of the Trust and to<br />
borrow monies or raise loans for the purpose of the Trust whenever he<br />
may deem it necessary to do so&#8221; (para 8 of the Trust deed).<br />
Furthermore, the Trustee had the &#8220;power and authority to spend and<br />
utilise the money and the property of the Trust for any of the purposes<br />
of this Trust in such manner as to him may appear proper&#8221;.<br />
It appears to us that, with this profit making background of the trust, its<br />
loosely stated objects the wide powers of the sole trustee, and the<br />
apparently profitable mode of conducting business, just like any<br />
commercial concern, disclosed not only by the terms of the trust but by<br />
the statement of total expenditure and income by the trustee it is very<br />
difficult to see what educational or other charitable purpose the trust<br />
was serving unless the dissemination of information and expression of<br />
opinions through the publications of the trust was in itself treated as the<br />
really educational and charitable purpose.<br />
In the trust deed before us, as we have already indicated,<br />
the trustee had not only wide powers of utilisation of<br />
trust funds for purposes of the trust but could divert its<br />
assets as well as any of the funds of the Trust to other<br />
institutions whose objects are &#8220;similar to the objects&#8221; of<br />
the trust and of &#8220;carrying out the objects and purposes of<br />
this trust either fully or partially&#8221;. The whole deed<br />
appears to me to be cleverly drafted so as to make the<br />
purpose of clause 2(c) resemble the one which was held<br />
to be protected from income-tax in the Tribune case<br />
(supra). Indeed the very language used by the Privy<br />
Council in the Tribune case (supra), for describing the<br />
objects of the Trust in that case, seems to have been<br />
kept in view by the draftsman of the trust deed before<br />
us. And, we find that the power of diverting the assets<br />
and income of the Trust although couched in language<br />
which seems designed to counsel their real effect is<br />
decisive on the question whether the trust is either<br />
wholly or predominantly for a charitable purpose or not.<br />
The trustees is given the power of deciding what 485<br />
purpose is allowed to or like an object covered by the<br />
trust and how it is to be served by a diversion of trust<br />
properties and funds. If the trustee is given the power to<br />
determine the proportion of such diversion, as he is given<br />
here, the trust could not be said to be wholly charitable.<br />
He could divert as much as to make the charitable part or<br />
aspect, if any, purely illusory. Indeed, this was the law<br />
even before the qualifying words introduced by the 1961<br />
Act. [See: East India Industries (Madras) Pvt. Ltd. v.<br />
Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras, (1967) 65 ITR 611<br />
(SC), Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras v. Andhra<br />
Page 196 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
Chamber of Commerce, (1965) 55 ITR 722 (SC) and Md.<br />
Ibrahim Riza v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Nagpur, AIR<br />
1930 PC 226. Such a &#8220;trust&#8221; would be of doubtful validity,<br />
but I refrain from further comment or any<br />
pronouncement upon the validity of such a trust as that<br />
was neither a question referred to the High Court in this<br />
case nor argued anywhere. “<br />
174. Thus, it appears that the Supreme Court looked into the<br />
trust deed of the trust in details and noticed that the sole<br />
trustee had not only wide powers of utilization of the trust<br />
funds for the purposes of the trust but he could divert its<br />
assets as well as any of the funds of the trust, to the other<br />
institutions whose objects were “similar to the objects” of the<br />
trust and of “carrying out the objects and purposes of such<br />
trust either fully or partially.” The Supreme Court observed<br />
that the whole deed appeared to be very cleverly drafted so as<br />
to make the purpose of clause (2)(c) resemble the one which<br />
was held to be protected from income tax in the Tribune case<br />
(1939) 7 ITR 415. (PC). The Supreme Court observed that if<br />
the trustee is given the power to determine the proportion of<br />
such diversion, the trust could not be said to be wholly<br />
charitable. This decision also is of no avail to the Revenue in<br />
the case at hand.<br />
175. In the case of Cricket Association of Bengal (supra), the<br />
assessee was an unregistered and unincorporated body. Its<br />
membership was open to the clubs, District Associations,<br />
Universities, Indian States, and subject to certain conditions,<br />
individuals. Its objects were roughly summarized as promotion<br />
of the game of cricket played in accordance with the highest<br />
standard. The Association received payments by way of<br />
subscriptions and donations. The ITO did not accept the plea of<br />
the assessee, seeking exemption. The ITO held that the object<br />
Page 197 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
of the Association was merely the promotion of a game and<br />
could not be termed as pursuing a charitable object. The<br />
order of the ITO was upheld by the AAC as well as the Tribunal.<br />
The matter went in appeal before the High Court of Calcutta.<br />
The High Court, while rejecting the appeal of the assessee,<br />
observed as under;<br />
“12. The question we have to consider is whether<br />
promotion of cricket as a general purpose or more<br />
particularly promotion of cricket in the form in which the<br />
Association professes to promote it can at all be a<br />
charitable purpose. In England, it has repeatedly been<br />
held that no gift or bequest made merely for the<br />
promotion of some game or pastime can be called a gift<br />
or bequest for a charitable purpose. An exception is to be<br />
found with respect to cases where provision is made for<br />
training in a game as a part of the education of youth. In<br />
those cases, the gift or bequest is regarded as charitable<br />
on the ground that it advances the cause of education. As<br />
instances of gifts or bequests for such purposes, I may<br />
refer to the case of In re, Mariette : Mariette v. Governing<br />
Body of Aldenham School, (1915) 2 Ch. 284, where a<br />
bequest was made to the Governing Body of a school for<br />
the purpose of building some squash racket courts and a<br />
further bequest was made to the Head Master for the<br />
time being upon trust to use the interest for providing a<br />
prize for some event in the school athletic sports every<br />
year. This bequest was upheld as charitable, because it<br />
was considered essential in a school of learning that<br />
there should be organised games as a part of the daily<br />
routine in order that the boys might not be left to<br />
themselves and that their bodily welfare might be<br />
promoted. Another instance is the case of Dupree&#8217;s Deed<br />
Trusts, In re, Daley v. Lloyds Bank, Ltd., (1945) 114 LJ Ch<br />
L where a deed of gift, expressed to be for the<br />
encouragement of chess playing by holding an annual<br />
chess tournament limited to boys and, young-men under<br />
the age of 21 years resident in a particular area, was held<br />
to be a good gift for a charitable purpose. It appears that<br />
Vaisey, J. who decided the case had to struggle a good<br />
deal against his own inclinations in order to arrive at the<br />
conclusion which he ultimately reached, but he said that<br />
Page 198 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
in view of the evidence before him that chess was<br />
included in the school curriculum and that according to<br />
the experience of the members of the teaching<br />
profession the game promoted concentration, selfreliance<br />
and reasoning, he would not condemn the gift as<br />
bad. The learned Judge, however, expressed the difficulty<br />
he felt in the following words :<br />
&#8220;One feels perhaps that one is on rather a slippery slope.<br />
It chess, why not draughts? if draughts, why not bezique?<br />
and so on, through to bridge, whist, and by another<br />
route, stamp collecting and the acquisition of birds&#8217;<br />
eggs?&#8221;<br />
I need not, however, deal with this class of cases,<br />
because the gifts in them were not merely for the<br />
promotion of some game or sports, but they were for<br />
training of youth in some game of skill or in athletic<br />
sports as a part of their education. Where, however, a gift<br />
or bequest has been made solely for the promotion of a<br />
game or pastime, it has always been struck down as not<br />
charitable. To take the case of In re: Nottage: Jones v.<br />
Palmer, (1895) 2 Ch. 649 which is so often cited, the four<br />
Judges who decided it, one in the High Court and three in<br />
the Court of Appeal, all held that a bequest for the<br />
encouragement of yacht racing, although it might be<br />
beneficial to the public, could not be upheld as<br />
charitable, because it was a bequest for the<br />
encouragement of a mere sport. Lindley, L. J. in the Court<br />
of Appeal made an observation in the course of his<br />
judgment which is peculiarly appropriate to the present<br />
case, since it mentions encouragement of the game of<br />
cricket :<br />
&#8220;Now, I should say&#8221;, observed the learned Judge, &#8220;that<br />
every healthy sport is good for the nation&#8211;cricket,<br />
football, fencing, yachting, or any other healthy exercise<br />
and recreation; but if it had been the idea of lawyers that<br />
a gift for the encouragement of such exercises is<br />
therefore charitable, we should have heard of it before<br />
now.&#8221;<br />
It will be noticed that the learned Lord Justice included<br />
cricket among the games in the illustrations he gave. The<br />
case was decided in 1895 and it may be said that ideas<br />
have since changed and that cricket has grown so much<br />
in popularity and the general public have come to be<br />
Page 199 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
associated so much with the game that the observations<br />
made so long ago are no longer valid. Any such<br />
contention must be overruled because even the<br />
recentmost cases have not expressed any dissent from<br />
the view taken in the Nottage case(1895-2 Ch. 649). It<br />
has often been cited and very recently it was cited in the<br />
case of Baddeley v. Inland Revenue Commissioners,<br />
(1953) 1 Ch 504 in the Court of Appeal and in the same<br />
case, Baddeley v. Inland Revenue Commra., (1955) AC<br />
572 in the House of Lords. &#8220;In re Nottage, 1895-2 Ch 649<br />
was cited for the proposition&#8221; observed Jenkins L. J. in the<br />
Court of Appeal.<br />
&#8220;that the encouragement of mere sport is not a charitable<br />
purpose. With regard to this authority, I need only say<br />
that in my view, neither of the trust here in question is a<br />
trust for the encouragement of mere sport&#8221;.<br />
It is noticeable that the learned Lord Justice did not<br />
dissent from the decision cited before him. A more<br />
elaborate reference to the case was made in the House of<br />
Lords and among the other Lords, Lord Reid made<br />
comments on it. Referring to the view taken in the Court<br />
of Appeal of the Nottage case, 1895-2 Ch 649, Lord Reid<br />
observed as follows :<br />
&#8220;In re Nottage, 1895-2 Ch 649 is clearly distinguishable :<br />
money was bequeathed to provide annually a cup for<br />
yacht racing, so the only possible beneficiaries were<br />
yacht owners who would be somewhat strange objects of<br />
charity. But what the appellants found on is the<br />
reasoning in the Court of Appeal to the effect that<br />
encouragement of a mere sport or game is not charitable<br />
though the sport or game may be beneficial to the public.<br />
No doubt that is true in the main, but it cannot apply to<br />
the provision or support of playing fields: yacht racing is<br />
far removed from the kind of recreation which Parliament<br />
has declared to be charitable. And a charitable purpose<br />
such as education may well be achieved in part at least<br />
by promoting. sport or games. The emphasis is on mere<br />
sport or games, and I cannot suppose that any of the<br />
learned Judges had in mind the Acts of Parliament<br />
dealing-with recreation or would have denied that the<br />
encouragement of games, as a means to achieve a<br />
charitable purpose for those who took part in them, was<br />
quite a different matter.&#8221;<br />
It will thus be seen that while promotion of games as a<br />
Page 200 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
part of the education of those who participate in them<br />
may be a charitable purpose, the promotion of the<br />
practice of a game in general either for the<br />
entertainment of the public or for an advancement of. the<br />
game itself has never been held to be charitable. So far<br />
as cricket is concerned, I shall content myself with citing<br />
only one other case, In re Patten, Westminster Bank,<br />
Limited v. Carlyon, 1929-2 Ch. 276. A trust was created<br />
for the benefit of the Sussex County Cricket Club and in<br />
order to bring the trust within the statute of Elizabeth, it<br />
was said that the trust was &#8220;for the supportation aid and<br />
help of young tradesmen handicraftsmen and persons<br />
decayed&#8221;. Really, however, it was a trust for the<br />
promotion of cricket among boys of the working and<br />
lower middle classes who might not be well off<br />
financially. Romer, J. who decided the case said that it<br />
might be that with the aid of the assistance provided<br />
from this trust, some boys would be enable to embark,<br />
upon life as professional cricketers, but he continued. to<br />
say : &#8220;It is, I think, reasonably clear that the object of the<br />
fund is the encouragement of the game of cricket and<br />
nothing else, and it has been held by authorities that are<br />
binding upon me that such a bequest is not charitable.&#8221;<br />
He then proceeded to refer to the case of In re Nottage,<br />
1895-2 Ch 649 as laying down the proposition to which<br />
he was giving effect.<br />
13. I do not think I should multiply citations in order to<br />
illustrate the point that a gift or bequest merely for the<br />
promotion of a game has never been considered<br />
charitable : Clifford, In re : Mallam v. McFie, (1911) 81 LJ<br />
Ch 220 was a case of angling; Trustees of Warnher&#8217;s<br />
Charitable Trust v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue,<br />
(1937) 21 Tax Cas 137, a case of playing fields. Scottish<br />
Flying Club, Ltd. v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue,<br />
(1936) 20 Tax. Cas 1, a case of an Aviation Club which<br />
held aerial pageants and charged fees for admission to<br />
the display and Inland Revenue Commissioners v. City of<br />
Glasgow Police Athletic Association, 1953 AC 380, a case<br />
of athletic sports of a police club. It is true that some of<br />
the decisions ultimately turned on the point that the<br />
beneficiary was not the public or a section of it, as<br />
understood in law, but incidentally observations were<br />
made in all of them as regards when promotion of a<br />
game can be a charitable purpose and when it cannot be.<br />
14. The facts of the present case are that the assessee<br />
Page 201 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
Association merely held certain demonstration or<br />
exhibition matches. It does not provide any training in<br />
the game of cricket to novices or any advanced training<br />
for persons who are already practiced players. Its<br />
activities outside the holding of the exhibition matches is<br />
limited entirely to its own members. The only contact it<br />
has with the public is by way of having them as<br />
spectators, on payment of a fee, of matches arranged by<br />
it. I find it impossible to hold that any benefit or<br />
entertainment which is thus paid for and which is availed<br />
of by only such members of the public as can or wish to<br />
pay for it can in any sense be a purpose of a charity. It is<br />
true that charity in the income-tax sense need not have<br />
any eleemosynary element in it and that an object of<br />
general public utility is under the income-tax law a<br />
charitable object. Indeed, if the objects professed by the<br />
Association, are to be treated as charitable objects at all,<br />
they can be so treated only if they can be regarded as<br />
objects of general public utility. I find it impossible to hold<br />
that there is any general public utility, so as to amount to<br />
a charity, in arranging for cricket matches which the<br />
public can see on payment. How untenable must be a<br />
contention that such an object is an object of general<br />
public utility and, therefore, must be held to be charitable<br />
will appear if one considers certain parallel cases.<br />
Suppose a body of men bind themselves together into a<br />
club and collect annually some musicians from all parts of<br />
the country to give demonstrations for a number of days<br />
and suppose the public are admitted to such<br />
demonstrations on payment of a fee. If the contention of<br />
the Association in the present case is to be accepted, it<br />
must equally be held that the body of men in the<br />
hypothetical case I have mentioned who derive a large<br />
income by selling admission to the musical<br />
demonstrations organised by them, are also exercising<br />
themselves for a charitable purpose and that their<br />
earnings must be equally exempt from tax.<br />
15. It was contended that the game of cricket had a place<br />
of its own among games and that it inculcated a spirit of<br />
fairness and an honourable conduct to such ah extent<br />
that the term &#8216;cricket&#8217; had come to be a synonym for<br />
fairness and honour. That may be so, but I am unable to<br />
understand how fairness and honour can be inculcated by<br />
the game of cricket in any person other than those who<br />
actually take part in it. In the present case, we are not<br />
Page 202 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
concerned with the players who play at the matches<br />
arranged by the Association, for they are members of the<br />
visiting teams or it might be local teams, but so far as the<br />
Association is concerned they are mostly outsiders. The<br />
Association is claiming to be advancing a charitable<br />
purpose only by providing an opportunity to the public to<br />
witness the games arranged by it. It can by no means be<br />
said that any spirit of fairness and honour is inculcated in<br />
the spectators of a game of cricket or perhaps any other<br />
game, played not by individuals but by teams. Indeed,<br />
there is a school of opinion, now growing in volume,<br />
which thinks that games played by rival teams drawn<br />
from different parts of the country or different countries<br />
and witnessed by multitudes do not serve any beneficial<br />
purpose, but, on the other hand cause a deterioration of<br />
the mind by fostering fanatical partisanships or<br />
generating mass hatreds. This, however, is a matter of<br />
opinion. Whether this extreme view is right or wrong, I<br />
find it impossible to hold that any benefit of a public<br />
character is conferred on the society or a section of it<br />
merely by the arrangement of exhibition games of cricket<br />
or tournaments and the admission of the public thereto<br />
for a fee, on the basis of which the purpose of arranging<br />
for such matches can be said to be a charitable purpose.<br />
16. There is another ground too upon which the<br />
Association&#8217;s claim must fail. I have already hinted at it,<br />
but will now point it out specifically. Among the objects<br />
set out in the Rules is one which authorises the<br />
Association to carry out any other business or activity<br />
which may seem to the Association capable of being<br />
carried on in connection with the above. Section 4 (3) (i)<br />
(a) and (b) of the Act which I have already read<br />
contemplate either a business carried on in the course of<br />
the carrying out of a primary purpose of the Association<br />
or a business, the work in connection with which is<br />
mainly carried on by the beneficiaries. There is no<br />
question of the business of playing cricket here being<br />
carried on by the beneficiaries of the Association,<br />
because the games are mainly played by outsiders. But<br />
the authority which the Rules confer on the Association to<br />
carry out any other business &#8220;in connection with the<br />
above,&#8221; that is to say, in connection with the promotion<br />
of the objects set out earlier, does not seem to me to<br />
come within the terms of Section 4 (3) (i) (a) which<br />
requires the business to be carried on in the course of<br />
Page 203 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
carrying out one of the primary purposes of the<br />
Association. If so, it appears to me that even assuming<br />
that there is a property and even assuming that the<br />
purpose of promoting the game of cricket is a charitable<br />
purpose, the property is here held not wholly for that<br />
purpose but it is held for other purposes as well.”<br />
176. The High Court, in the aforesaid case, took notice of the<br />
fact that the Association merely held certain demonstration or<br />
exhibition matches. It did not provide any training in the game<br />
of cricket to novices or any advanced training for the persons<br />
who were already practiced players. The High Court further<br />
noticed that the activities of the Association, outside the<br />
holding of the exhibition matches, was limited entirely to its<br />
own members. The High Court also noticed that the only<br />
contact the Association had with the public was by way of<br />
having them as spectators on payment of a fee of matches<br />
arranged by it. Thus, having regard to what has been referred<br />
to above, the High Court, ultimately, took the view that the<br />
Association was engaged in any charitable objects. The facts in<br />
the case on hand are altogether different.<br />
177. In the case of N.N. Desai Charitable Trust (supra), this<br />
Court ruled that howsoever laudable the objects of the trust<br />
may be, and such objects may lead one to believe that the<br />
activities of the trust are charitable in nature, but for the<br />
purpose of seeking exemption under Section 11 of the Act, the<br />
actual activities are to be seen and not just the objects. There<br />
need not be any debate on this proposition of law. In the case<br />
on hand, after a detailed scrutiny of the various activities, the<br />
tribunal has recorded a finding of fact that the activities, in<br />
fact, are charitable in nature.<br />
Page 204 of 205<br />
C/TAXAP/268/2012 JUDGMENT<br />
178. In such circumstances, referred to above, we are of the<br />
view that the Tribunal could be said to have taken a<br />
reasonable view of the matter, and having recorded a finding<br />
of fact based on the material on record, we should not disturb<br />
such finding of fact.<br />
179. In the result, all the tax appeals fail and are hereby<br />
dismissed. The substantial questions of law, formulated in all<br />
the tax appeals, are answered in favour of the assessees and<br />
against the Revenue.<br />
