Order<br />
12 th July, 2019<br />
The above noted batch of writ applications, projects a<br />
challenge to the jurisdiction of the income tax authorities in<br />
initiation of proceedings under section 24 of the Prohibition of<br />
Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988 (for short, Benami Act of<br />
1988), as amended vide Benami Transactions (Prohibition)<br />
Amendment Act, 2016 (for short, Benami Amendment Act of<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(26 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
2016), which came into effect on 01st November, 2016. Hence, the<br />
matters have been entertained collectively for final adjudication at<br />
this stage by this common order consented by the counsel for the<br />
parties.<br />
2. Shorn off unnecessary details, the essential skeletal material<br />
facts needs to be taken note of for adjudication of the controversy<br />
are: that the Income Tax Department conducted search and<br />
seizure under Section 132 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, on various<br />
premises belonging to the petitioners and in course of search and<br />
seizure, several incriminating documents were found, indicating<br />
several benami transactions in purchase of lands involved herein.<br />
Accordingly, show cause notices were issued under section 24 (1)<br />
of the amended Benami Act of 1988, to show cause why action<br />
should not be taken against them under Section 24 (4) of the<br />
amended Benami Act of 1988, as the consideration was actually<br />
paid by the petitioners but the land was purchased in the name<br />
and by another person, thus, making it a clear case of benami<br />
transaction. The respondent department made order of provisional<br />
attachment under Section 24 (3) of the amended Benami Act, in<br />
respect of the properties mentioned in the show cause notices. It<br />
is pleaded case of the petitioners that the initiating officer has<br />
acted without jurisdiction, as the Benami Transaction (Prohibition)<br />
Amendment Act, 2016, came into effect on 01st November, 2016<br />
and the alleged benami transactions took place prior to that date.<br />
The said notices were responded in the same terms. However, the<br />
Initiating Officer of the respondent department made order under<br />
Section 24 (4) of the amended Benami Amendment Act of 2016,<br />
continuing the provisional attachment of the properties involved<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(27 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
herein. Thereafter, further show cause notices were issued by the<br />
Adjudicating Authority under the provisions of the Benami<br />
Amendment Act of 2016, as to why the order of provisional<br />
attachment of the benami properties should not be confirmed and<br />
the matters are still pending before the said authority. The<br />
petitioners, aggrieved of initiation of the proceedings and orders<br />
aforesaid, for being without jurisdiction, have instituted the instant<br />
writ petitions before this court.<br />
3. Mr. Kamlakar Sharma, learned senior counsel for the<br />
petitioner(s), stated that the initiation of the very proceedings for<br />
provisional attachment of the alleged benami properties, from the<br />
very beginning is per se illegal and arbitrary, as the alleged<br />
benami transactions took place before the search proceedings and<br />
the Benami Amendment Act of 2016, that came into existence<br />
with effect from 01st November, 2016, vide notification dated 25th<br />
October, 2016, and therefore, the Benami Amendment Act of<br />
2016, shall have prospective effect. Since the alleged benami<br />
transactions and date of discovery of the alleged benami<br />
transactions, are, of a date prior to coming into force of the<br />
Benami Amendment Act of 2016; hence, the provisions as such<br />
are inapplicable to the present cases.<br />
4. Learned counsel for the petitioners vehemently asserted that<br />
the intent in introduction of the Benami Amendment Act of 2016,<br />
was to eradicate the discrepancies and loop holes that have crept<br />
in with passage of time after the introduction of the Benami Act of<br />
1988. Further, referring to the text of section 1 and 6 of the<br />
Benami Amendment Act of 2016, it is vociferously contended that<br />
it was never the intention of either the legislation or the executive<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(28 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
that the provisions of the Benami Amendment Act of 2016; be<br />
applicable with retrospective effect. According to the learned<br />
counsel for the petitioners, the language employed with the<br />
statement that whoever enters into any benami transaction on<br />
and after the date of commencement of the Benami Amendment<br />
Act of 2016, that is on 1st November, 2016 or afterwards; leaves<br />
no room for any doubt that the alleged benami transactions so<br />
transacted by the petitioners, before the commencement of the<br />
Benami Amendment Act of 2016, doesn’t fall under its purview.<br />
5. In the backdrop of section 3 (3) of Benami Act of 1988 and<br />
new section 53 of Benami Amendment Act of 2016, it is pointed<br />
out that the punishment for benami transaction under Benami Act<br />
of 1988, was imprisonment for 3 years, which has been now<br />
extended to 7 years, through the Benami Amendment Act of<br />
2016. Therefore, the said amendment and provisions introduced,<br />
cannot be applied retrospectively with penal consequences.<br />
6. It was further added by the learned senior counsel for the<br />
petitioners that as per the earlier provisions of the Benami Act of<br />
1988, the benami property was to be acquired by the Government<br />
by acquisition and no compensation was to be paid for the such<br />
acquisition. Rules and Regulations for the acquisition aforesaid,<br />
were supposed to follow the Act of 1988, but the same were never<br />
framed and notified thus making the acquisition of land through<br />
benami transaction, under the old/un-amended provisions<br />
redundant. Now, as per the provisions of the Benami Amendment<br />
Act of 2016, the said benami property shall be confiscated instead<br />
of acquisition. For confiscation of property, is a penal provision<br />
which can only be prospective and if the penal provision is to be<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(29 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
applied retrospectively, that would be arbitrary, illegal and in<br />
violation of the Article 20 of the Constitution of India in absence of<br />
any contemplation to that effect under the amended Act. Thus,<br />
Benami Amendment Act of 2016; cannot have retrospective<br />
application.<br />
7. Counsel for the petitioners repelling the preliminary<br />
contention as to the very maintainability of the instant writ<br />
petitions for the matters were stated to be pending before the<br />
Adjudicating Authority, and therefore, being pre-mature and not<br />
maintainable before this court; contended that a glance of section<br />
24 of the Benami Amendment Act of 2016; would reflect that writ<br />
petitions are very much maintainable. For as per Section 24 (1) of<br />
the Benami Amendment Act of 2016, the Initiating Officer shall<br />
issue notice to show cause as to why the property in question<br />
shall not be considered a benami property and further issue notice<br />
of provisional attachment of the said benami property. Moreover,<br />
there is no provision provided in section 24 of the Benami<br />
Amendment Act of 2016, to file an appeal against the provisional<br />
attachment of the alleged benami property. Thus, the petitioners<br />
are left with no option other than to invoke the jurisdiction of this<br />
court under Article 226 and/or 227 of the Constitution of India.<br />
Further, the petitioners have challenged the very jurisdiction and<br />
authority of the respondent department to make such a<br />
provisional attachment of the alleged benami property, and<br />
therefore, the instant writ petitions are maintainable as the<br />
petitioners have no other remedy for redressal of their grievance.<br />
8. It is further alleged that the respondent department has<br />
initiated the proceeding involved herein in order to harass and<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(30 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
torment the petitioners for it is evident from the fact that the<br />
respondent department referred the matters to the Adjudicating<br />
Authority so soon they learned of the institution of the instant writ<br />
applications by the petitioners before this court. Furthermore, the<br />
respondent department issued notices under Section 24 (3) of the<br />
Benami Amendment Act of 2016, to the petitioners on the very<br />
same day when it issued notice to the local authorities to provide<br />
information with respect to the transactions made in regard to the<br />
alleged subject benami property. The notices under Section 24 (3)<br />
of the Benami Amendment Act of 2016; are to be issued after<br />
making thorough inquires and examination of reports or evidences<br />
and not after issuing notices. Therefore, oblique intent of the<br />
respondent department is apparent on the face of record.<br />
9. It is also pointed that no Rules could have been framed in<br />
exercise of powers under section 68 of the Benami Amendment<br />
Act of 2016, before 1st November, 2016 i.e. the date of its<br />
commencement. Hence, the Rules framed under the Benami<br />
Amendment Act of 2016, are of no consequence. In order to<br />
fortify their stand learned counsel for the petitioners have relied<br />
upon the following dictionary meaning of term confiscation, phrase<br />

10. Per contra: Mr. Prabhuling K. Navadgi, learned Sr. counsel<br />
with Mr. Prabhansh Sharma and Mr. R.B. Mathur, advocates,<br />
resisted the claim of the petitioners raising preliminary objections<br />
as to the very maintainability of the writ applications at this stage<br />
while the entire proceedings are pending consideration before the<br />
Adjudicating Authority. Learned counsel vehemently contended<br />
that it is well settled proposition of law that jurisdiction under<br />
Article 226 and/or 227 of the Constitution of India can only be<br />
exercised when there is no remedy available to the parties.<br />
According to the learned counsel for the respondents, law in this<br />
reference is no more res-integra, as has been declared by the<br />
Apex Court of the land on several occasions. In the backdrop of<br />
the provisions of Benami Act of 1988, as amended vide Benami<br />
Amendment Act of 2016, it is contended that any order made by<br />
the authority therein, would be open to inquiry before the<br />
Adjudicating Authority under Section 25 and 26 of the amended<br />
Act. Further, the order made by Adjudicating Authority under<br />
Section 26 (3), is open to an appeal before the Appellate Tribunal<br />
as would be evident from Section 46 of the amended Benami Act<br />
of 1988. And finally, Section 49 contemplates an appeal to the<br />
High Court, to any party aggrieved by any decision or order of the<br />
Appellate Tribunal within a period of 60 days, from the date of<br />
communication of the order made by the Appellate Tribunal, on<br />
any question of law arising out of such an order.<br />
11. Furthermore, according to learned senior counsel, the<br />
petitioners have admitted the fact that the matters are still<br />
pending before the Adjudicating Authority. Thus, the petitioners<br />
have instituted the present writ applications, contrary to the<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(34 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
Scheme of the Benami Act of 1988, as amended in the year 2016,<br />
which provides a complete self contained procedure for resolution<br />
of the matters arising therein; hence, the instant batch of writ<br />
applications is premature and is not maintainable, and therefore,<br />
deserve to be dismissed on that ground alone.<br />
12. Learned Senior Counsel for the respondents also emphasized<br />
that the provisions introduced by way of Benami Amendment Act<br />
of 2016, would have retrospective application and cannot be<br />
considered to be prospective keeping in view of the underlying<br />
object and intendment in introduction of amended Benami Act of<br />
1988. It is urged that the main object behind introduction of the<br />
Benami Act of 1988, on 19 May 1988, was to make benami<br />
transactions offence and to acquire such benami properties<br />
through acquisition without compensation as per the procedure<br />
prescribed therein, so that the unjust gains and benefits of<br />
evasion of taxes could be avoided. Hence, keeping in view the<br />
intendment and object in introduction of amended Benami Act of<br />
1988; incorporating necessary amendments introduced through<br />
Benami Amendment Act of 2016, only clarified and amplified the<br />
intention of legislature in order to effectively cure and curb the<br />
mischief of ever increasing corruption, which was the also<br />
intended under the Principal Act i.e. Benami Act of 1988; enacted<br />
on 19 May 1988.<br />
13. According to learned counsel for the respondents,<br />
confiscation of the benami property, a replacement, by way of<br />
amendment, is not a new introduction in totality to the Benami Act<br />
of 1988. Acquisition without compensation is nothing but<br />
confiscation only; therefore, substitution of the term<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(35 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
acquisition by another term i.e. confiscation, cannot be termed<br />
as penal, in the backdrop of the object sought to be achieved<br />
through the Benami Amendment Act of 2016.<br />
14. It is further pointed out that similarly, change in the<br />
definition of all ‘Benami Transaction’ would not alter the object and<br />
purpose which remains the same as contemplated under the<br />
principal Benami Act of 1988. The change in definition only<br />
clarifies and amplifies the existing definition, without imposing any<br />
new liability or right accruing to the parties. Thus, the amendment<br />
in the definition of ‘Benami Transaction’ is only descriptive and<br />
explanatory substitution. Referring to Rule of Hayden’s case, it is<br />
contended that Lord Edverd Coke evolved the well accepted test to<br />
understand the effectiveness of a new amendment on the<br />
following criteria:<br />
(i) what was the law before making of the law;<br />
(ii) what was the mischief and defect before the Act was<br />
passed;<br />
(iii) what remedy the Parliament as appointed; and<br />
(iv) what was the reason of the remedy.<br />
15. Hence, applying the test aforesaid, to the question of<br />
retrospective application of the amended provisions,<br />
involved in the instant batch of writ applications, would make it<br />
evident that the object in introduction of the amendments,<br />
through Benami Amendment Act of 2016, is to effectively cure the<br />
mischief which could not be checked effectively, as intended by<br />
the Principal Act of 1988. Therefore, if the amendments are not<br />
applied retrospectively, that would defeat the very purpose and<br />
object of its introduction. Hence, provisions of Benami Amendment<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(36 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
Act of 2016, keeping in view the underlying object, shall have<br />
retrospective application in order to effectively cure the mischief<br />
that persisted all along even after enactment of the unamended<br />
Benami Act of 1988, which consisted only of 9 Sections.<br />
16. Learned counsel would further contend that a glance of text<br />
of section 3 (3) of the Benami Amendment Act of 2016, in no<br />
uncertain terms contemplates that penalty for benami<br />
transactions, on or after commencement of the Benami<br />
Amendment Act of 2016, would only be punishable in accordance<br />
with the provisions contained under Chapter VII of the<br />
Amendment Act of 2016. Since, the provision itself contemplates<br />
penalty for benami transactions on or after the commencement of<br />
the Benami Amendment Act of 2016, that would not mean that<br />
the benami transactions prior to its commencement, shall be free<br />
from liability. According to learned counsel, the intended object of<br />
the statute by amendment, involved herein is two fold; firstly,<br />
benami transactions entered into on or after commencement of<br />
Benami Amendment Act of 2016, shall be punishable under the<br />
amended provisions contained in Chapter VII by imprisonment for<br />
seven years, and; secondly, the benami transactions prior to the<br />
commencement of Benami Amendment Act of 2016, shall be<br />
penalized by the existing provisions contained in the unamended<br />
Benami Act of 1988, i.e by three years imprisonment. Thus, the<br />
provision only provides for an enhanced punishment for benami<br />
transactions entered into on or after commencement of Benami<br />
Amendment Act of 2016. Hence, no right to any party has accrued<br />
nor a new liability created as to the pending benami transactions.<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(37 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
17. Reference has also been made to text of Section 65 of the<br />
amended Benami Act of 1988, which contemplates transfer of<br />
pending cases. According to learned senior counsel, a glance of<br />
the text of Section 65 would reflect that the procedure provided<br />
therein for prevention of ‘Benami Transactions’ under the<br />
provisions of Benami Amendment Act of 2016, shall also apply to<br />
all the ‘Benami Transactions’ pending on enactment of the Benami<br />
Amendment Act of 2016. Hence, retrospective applicability of the<br />
amended Act of the Benami Act of 1988, is explicit. In order to<br />
buttress his contentions reliance is placed on the following<br />

19. Considering the entire factual matrix, materials available on<br />
record and pleadings of the parties, in the above noted writ<br />
applications in totality, this court concluded to deal with the larger<br />
question of retrospective applicability of the Benami Amendment<br />
Act, 2016, consented by the counsel for the parties. Thus, the<br />
question framed for determination, in substance, is:<br />
Whether the provisions of Benami Amendment Act,<br />
2016, shall be applicable retrospectively or not?<br />
20. At the very outset, it will be in the fitness of things to deal<br />
with the preliminary objection raised by the learned senior<br />
counsel, appearing on behalf of the respondents as to the<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(40 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
maintainability of the writ applications in view of the scheme of<br />
the Benami Amendment Act, 2016, and in view of the opinion of<br />
the Supreme Court in the case of Vodafone International<br />
Holdings B.V. (supra). A glance of the opinion referred to and<br />
relied upon would reflect that the Supreme Court while relying<br />
upon earlier opinion in the case of the Management of Express<br />
Newspapers Ltd. vs. Workers and Staff Employed under it<br />
and Ors.: AIR 1963 SC 569; observed that normally, the<br />
questions of facts, though they may be jurisdictional facts, the<br />
decision of which depends upon the appreciation of evidence,<br />
should be left to be tried by the Special Tribunals constituted for<br />
that purpose. The Supreme Court in no uncertain terms, in the<br />
same opinion, observed that it did not lay down any fixed or<br />
inflexible rule; whether or not even the preliminary facts should<br />
be tried by a High Court in a writ petition, for the same would<br />
depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case and upon<br />
the nature of the preliminary issue raised between the parties.<br />
21. The factual matrix of the matters at hand, is entirely<br />
different and distinguishable, wherein the fact that the alleged<br />
benami transactions, involved herein, are of a date prior to seizure<br />
and search conducted by the respondent-department, and also, of<br />
the date the provisions of Benami Amendment Act of 2016,<br />
brought into force i.e. 1st November, 2016. Hence, the<br />
question in the instant batch of writ applications for determination<br />
and adjudication, as to the retrospective application of the<br />
amended provisions introduced vide Benami Amendment Act of<br />
2016, amending the Prohibition of Benami Transactions Act, 1988;<br />
is a pure question of law. Thus, there is no factual matrix which<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(41 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
requires evidence and consequent appreciation and determination<br />
thereon, in view of the undisputed statement as to the alleged<br />
benami transactions, which happens to be of dates precedent to<br />
the enactment of Benami Amendment Act of 2016.<br />
22. It is also not in dispute that the rules in exercise of powers<br />
conferred by virtue of Section 68 of the Benami Amendment Act of<br />
2016, have been notified on 25th October, 2016, even before the<br />
substantive section 68 of the Benami Amendment Act of 2016,<br />
was made effective for which date appointed is 1st November,<br />
2016.<br />
23. In the case of Whirlpool Corporation (supra), the Apex<br />
Court of the land held thus:<br />
“13. Learned counsel for the appellant has contended<br />
that since suo motu action Under Section 56(4) could<br />
be taken only by the High Court and not by the<br />
Registrar, the notice issued to the appellant was wholly<br />
without jurisdiction and, therefore, a writ petition even<br />
at that stage was maintainable. The appellant, in these<br />
circumstances, was not obliged to wait for the Registrar<br />
to complete the proceedings as any further order<br />
passed by the Registrar would also have been without<br />
jurisdiction.<br />
14. The power to issue prerogative writs under Article<br />
226 of the Constitution is plenary in nature and is not<br />
limited by any other provision of the Constitution This<br />
power can be exercised by the High Court not only for<br />
issuing writs in the nature of Habeas Corpus,<br />
Mandamus, prohibition, Qua Warranto and Certiorari for<br />
the enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights<br />
contained in Part III of the Constitution but also for<br />
&#8220;any other purpose&#8221;.<br />
15. Under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High<br />
Court, having regard to the facts of the case, has<br />
discretion to entertain or not to entertain a writ<br />
petition. But the High Court has imposed upon itself<br />
certain restrictions one of which is that if an effective<br />
and efficacious remedy is available, the High Court<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(42 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
would not normally exercise its jurisdiction. But the<br />
alternative remedy has been consistently held by this<br />
court not to operate as a bar in at least three<br />
contingencies, namely, where the Writ Petition has<br />
been filed for the enforcement of any of the<br />
Fundamental rights or where there has been a violation<br />
of the principle of natural justice or where the order or<br />
proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires<br />
of an Act is challenged.There is a plethora of case law<br />
on this point but to cut down this circle of forensic<br />
whirlpool we would rely on some old decisions of the<br />
evolutionary era of the constitutional law as they still<br />
hold the field.<br />
20. Much water has since flown beneath the bridge, but<br />
there has been no corrosive effect on these decisions<br />
which though old, continue to hold the field with the<br />
result that law as to the jurisdiction of the High Court in<br />
entertaining a Writ Petition under Article 226 of the<br />
Constitution, in spite of the alternative statutory<br />
remedies, is not affected, specially in a case where the<br />
authority against whom the Writ is filed is shown to<br />
have had no jurisdiction or had purported to usurp<br />
jurisdiction without any legal foundation.<br />
21. That being so, the High Court was not justified in<br />
dismissing the Writ Petition at the initial stage without<br />
examining the contention that the show cause notice<br />
issued to the appellant was wholly without jurisdiction<br />
and that the Registrar, in the circumstances of the<br />
case, was not justified in acting as the &#8220;TRIBUNAL&#8221;.”<br />
24. A glance of the observations of the Apex Court of the land,<br />
as extracted herein-above, would reflect that factual matrix of the<br />
matters at hand, is entirely different and distinguishable from the<br />
factual matrix of the Vodafone International Holdings B.V.<br />
(supra), that fell for consideration of the Supreme Court. Hence,<br />
the opinion referred to and relied upon is of no help to the<br />
respondents in support of preliminary objection as to<br />
maintainability of the writ applications under Article 226 of the<br />
Constitution.<br />

(43 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
25. In the case of Calcutta Discount Company Limited<br />
(supra), a Constitution Bench of the Apex Court of the land while<br />
examining the rejection order on a writ application under Article<br />
226 of the Constitution of India, in the backdrop of notices issued<br />
under Section 34 of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922, wherein the<br />
Income Tax Officer called upon the Company to submit fresh<br />
returns of its total income; in no uncertain terms observed that<br />
the pretended notice was issued without existence of the<br />
necessary conditions precedent, which confers jurisdiction under<br />
section 34; and therefore, the aggrieved party approaching the<br />
court at the earliest opportunity, could not be denied relief for<br />
existence of such alternative remedy is not however always a<br />
sufficient reason for refusing a party quick relief by a writ or order<br />
prohibiting an authority acting without jurisdiction from continuing<br />
such action. At this juncture, it will relevant to take note of the<br />
text of the opinion aforesaid, which reads thus:<br />
“1. This appeal is against an appellate decision of a<br />
Bench of the Calcutta High Court by which in reversal of<br />
the order made by the Trial Judge the Bench rejected<br />
the present appellant&#8217;s application under Article 226 of<br />
the Constitution. The appellant is a private limited<br />
company incorporated under the Indian Company&#8217;s Act<br />
and has its registered office in Calcutta. It was assessed<br />
to income-tax for the assessment years, 1942-43,<br />
1943-44 and 1944-45 by three separate orders dated<br />
January 26, 1944, February 12, 1944, and February 15,<br />
1945, respectively. These assessments were made<br />
under section 23(3) of the Indian Income-tax Act upon<br />
returns filed by it accompanied by statements of<br />
account. The first two assessments were made by Mr. L.<br />
D. Rozario the then Income-tax Officer had the last one<br />
by Mr. K. D. Banerjee. The taxes assessed were duly<br />
paid up. On March 28, 1951, three notices purporting to<br />
be under section 34 of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922,<br />
were issued by the Income-tax Officer calling upon the<br />
company to submit fresh returns of its total income and<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(44 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
the total world income assessable for the three<br />
accounting years relating to the three assessment<br />
years, 1942-43 1943-44 and 1944-45. The appellant<br />
company furnished returns in compliance with the<br />
notices but on September 18, 1951, applied to the High<br />
Court of Calcutta for issue under article 226 of the<br />
Constitution of appropriate writs or orders directing the<br />
Income-tax Officer not to proceed to assess it on the<br />
basis of these notices. The first ground on which this<br />
prayer was based was mentioned in the petition in these<br />
terms: &#8211; &#8220;The said pretended notice was issued without<br />
the existence of the necessary conditions precedent<br />
which confers jurisdiction under section 34<br />
aforementioned, whether before or after the<br />
amendment in 1948.&#8221; The other ground urged was that<br />
the amendment to section 34 of the Income-tax Act in<br />
1948 was not retrospective and that the assessment for<br />
the years 1942-43, 1943-44 and 1944-45 became<br />
barred long before March 1951.<br />
2. The Trial Judge held that the first ground was not<br />
made out but being of opinion that the amending Act of<br />
1948 was not retrospective, he held that the notices<br />
issued were without jurisdiction. Accordingly he made<br />
an order prohibiting the Income-tax Officer from<br />
continuing the assessment proceedings on the basis of<br />
the impugned notices.<br />
3. The learned Judges who heard the appeal agreed<br />
with the Trial Judge that the first ground had not been<br />
made out. They held however that in consequence of<br />
the amendment of section 34 in 1948 the objection on<br />
the ground of limitation must also fail. A point of<br />
constitutional law which appears to have been raised<br />
before the appeal court was also rejected. The appeal<br />
was allowed and the company&#8217;s application under article<br />
226 was dismissed with costs.<br />
6. To confer jurisdiction under this section to issue<br />
notice in respect of assessments beyond the period of<br />
four years, but within a period of eight years, from the<br />
end of the relevant year two conditions have therefore<br />
to be satisfied. The first is that the Income-tax Officer<br />
must have reason to believe that income, profits or<br />
gains chargeable to income-tax have been underassessed.<br />
The second is that he must have also reason<br />
to believe that such &#8220;under assessment&#8221; has occurred<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(45 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
by reason of either (i) omission or failure on the part of<br />
an assessee to make a return of his income under<br />
section 22, or (ii) omission or failure on the part of an<br />
assessee to disclose fully and truly and all material facts<br />
necessary for his assessment for that year. Both these<br />
conditions are conditions precedent to be satisfied<br />
before the Income-tax Officer could have jurisdiction to<br />
issue a notice for the assessment or reassessment<br />
beyond the period of four years but within the period of<br />
eight years, from the end of the year in question.<br />
24. We are therefore bound to hold that the conditions<br />
precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction under section<br />
34 of the Income-tax Act did not exist and the Incometax<br />
Officer had therefore no jurisdiction to issue the<br />
impugned notices under section 34 in respect of the<br />
years 1942-43, 1943-44 and 1944-45 after the expiry<br />
of four years.<br />
25. Mr. Sastri argued that the question whether the<br />
Income-tax Officer had reason to believe that underassessment<br />
had occurred &#8220;by reason of non-disclosure<br />
of material facts&#8221; should not be investigated by the<br />
courts in an application under article 226. Learned<br />
Counsel seems to suggest that as soon as the Incometax<br />
Officer has reason to believe that there has been<br />
under-assessment in any year he has jurisdiction to<br />
start proceedings under section 34 by issuing a notice<br />
provided 8 years have not elapsed from the end of the<br />
year in question, but whether the notices should have<br />
been issued within a period of 4 years or not is only a<br />
question of limitation which could and should properly<br />
be raised in the assessment proceedings. It is wholly<br />
incorrect however to suppose that this is a question of<br />
limitation only not touching the question of jurisdiction.<br />
The scheme of the law clearly is that where the Incometax<br />
Officer has reason to believe that an under<br />
assessment has resulted from non-disclosure he shall<br />
have jurisdiction to start proceedings for re-assessment<br />
within a period of 8 years; and where he has reason to<br />
believe that an under assessment has resulted from<br />
other causes he shall have jurisdiction to start<br />
proceedings for reassessment within 4 years. Both the<br />
conditions, (i) the Income-tax Officer having reason to<br />
believe that there has been under assessment and (ii)<br />
his having reason to believe that such under<br />
assessment has resulted from non-disclosure of material<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(46 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
facts, must co-exist before the Income-tax Officer has<br />
jurisdiction to start proceedings after the expiry of 4<br />
years. The argument that the Court ought not to<br />
investigate the existence of one of these conditions,<br />
viz., that the Income-tax Officer has reason to believe<br />
that under assessment has resulted from non-disclosure<br />
of material facts cannot therefore be accepted.<br />
26. Mr. Sastri next pointed out that at the stage when<br />
the Income-tax Officer issued the notices he was not<br />
acting judicially or quasi-judicially and so a writ of<br />
certiorari or prohibition cannot issue. It is well settled<br />
however that though the writ of prohibition or certiorari<br />
will not issue against an executive authority, the High<br />
Courts have power to issue in a fit case an order<br />
prohibiting an executive authority from acting without<br />
jurisdiction. Where such action of an executive authority<br />
from acting without jurisdiction subjects or is likely to<br />
subject a person to lengthy proceedings and<br />
unnecessary harassment, the High Courts, it is well<br />
settled, will issue appropriate orders or directions to<br />
prevent such consequences.<br />
27. Mr. Sastri mentioned more than once the fact that<br />
the company would have sufficient opportunity to raise<br />
this question, viz., whether the Income-tax Officer had<br />
reason to believe that under assessment had resulted<br />
from non-disclosure of material facts, before the<br />
Income-tax Officer himself in the assessment<br />
proceedings and, if unsuccessful there, before the<br />
appellate Officer or the appellate tribunal or in the High<br />
Court under section 66(2) of the Indian Income-tax Act.<br />
The existence of such alternative remedy is not however<br />
always a sufficient reason for refusing a party quick<br />
relief by a writ or order prohibiting an authority acting<br />
without jurisdiction from continuing such action.<br />
28. In the present case the company contends that the<br />
conditions precedent for the assumption of jurisdiction<br />
under section 34 were not satisfied and came to the<br />
court at the earliest opportunity. There is nothing in its<br />
conduct which would justify the refusal of proper relief<br />
under article 226. When the Constitution confers on the<br />
High Courts the power to give relief it becomes the duty<br />
of the courts to give such relief in fit cases and the<br />
courts would be failing to perform their duty if relief is<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(47 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
refused without adequate reasons. In the present case<br />
we can find no reason for which relief should be refused.<br />
38. That the Income Tax Officer has reason to believe<br />
that there was under assessment in the material years<br />
was not challenged by the appellant and in our opinion<br />
rightly. There are on the record the reports of Income<br />
Tax Officer in which the belief is expressly set out. It<br />
also appears from the assessment orders for the years<br />
1945-46 and 1946-47 that tax has been assessed on<br />
the profits made by sale of shares by the company in<br />
those years.”<br />
26. In the Raza Textiles Ltd. (supra), while examining the<br />
question as to whether the order of Income Tax Officer, a<br />
quasi judicial authority, is, subject to review by the High<br />
Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, was ruled<br />
in affirmative. At this stage, it will be profitable to take note<br />
of contents of paragraph 3 of the opinion aforesaid, which<br />
reads thus:<br />
“3. Aggrieved by that order the appellant went up in<br />
appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. The<br />
Appellate Assistant Commissioner rejected the appeal<br />
on the ground that the same was not maintainable. He<br />
took the view that an appeal lay only under Section<br />
30(1A). But before such an appeal can be entertained<br />
the appellant must satisfy two conditions, namely, (1)<br />
he had deducted the tax due from the non-resident in<br />
accordance with the provisions of Sub-section 3(B) and<br />
(2) that he had paid the sum deducted to the<br />
Government. The appellant having not complied with<br />
those two conditions, the Appellate Assistant<br />
Commissioner held that the appeal was incompetent.<br />
The order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was<br />
confirmed by- the Tribunal. Thereafter the appellant<br />
moved the High Court under Article 226 of the<br />
Constitution. That application came up before a single<br />
Judge. The single Judge after going into the matter in<br />
detail came to the conclusion that M/s. Nathirmal and<br />
Sons is not a non-resident firm and that being so the<br />
appellant was not required to act under Section 18(3B).<br />
He accordingly, set aside the order impugned. The<br />
revenue went up in appeal against the order of the<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(48 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
learned single Judge to the Appellate Bench. That Bench<br />
allowed the appeal with the observations, &#8220;In the<br />
present case the question before the Income-tax Officer,<br />
Rampur, was whether the firm Nathirmal and Sons was<br />
non-resident or not. There was material before him on<br />
this question. He had jurisdiction to decide the question<br />
either way. It cannot be said that the officer assumed<br />
jurisdiction by wrong decision on this question of<br />
residence&#8221;. The Appellate Bench appears to have been<br />
under the impression that the Income-tax Officer was<br />
the sole judge of the fact whether the firm in question<br />
was resident or non-resident. This conclusion, in our<br />
opinion, is wholly wrong. No authority, much less a<br />
quasi-judicial authority, can confer jurisdiction on<br />
itself by deciding a jurisdictional fact wrongly. The<br />
question whether the jurisdictional fact has been<br />
rightly decided or not is a question that is open for<br />
examination by the High Court in an application<br />
for a writ of certiorari. If the High Court comes to<br />
the conclusion, as the learned single Judge has<br />
done in this case, that the Income-tax Officer had<br />
clutched at the jurisdiction by deciding a<br />
jurisdictional fact erroneously, then the assesses<br />
was entitled for the writ of certiorari prayed for by<br />
him. It is incomprehensible to think that a quasijudicial<br />
authority like the Income-tax Officer can<br />
erroneously decide a jurisdictional fact and<br />
thereafter proceed to impose a levy on a citizen.<br />
In our opinion the Appellate Bench is wholly wrong in<br />
opining that the Income-tax Officer can &#8220;decide either<br />
way&#8221;.<br />
27. In the case of Malayala Manorama Co. Ltd. (supra), the<br />
Apex Court of the land on a survey of earlier opinions including<br />
Whirlpool Corporation (supra), repelling the plea of availability<br />
of statutory alternative remedy while remanding the matter back<br />
to the High Court, observed thus:<br />
“5. The assessee firm did not take recourse to the<br />
statutory remedies available under the Act but<br />
questioned the very correctness and legality of the<br />
issuance of the notice as well as the order passed by<br />
the Assistant Commissioner before the High Court of<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />

(49 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
Kerala at Ernakulam, by filing a writ petition<br />
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.<br />
6. This writ petition was contested by the Department<br />
which filed detailed counter affidavit. It was specifically<br />
pleaded by the Department that for availability of<br />
statutory alternative remedy as well as for other<br />
reasons and facts stated in the reply, the writ petition<br />
itself was not maintainable. The Division Bench of the<br />
High Court while considering this primary objection<br />
raised by the Department before the High Court, came<br />
to the conclusion that as the facts were not in dispute<br />
and questions raised were purely legal and are to be<br />
tested in view of the judgment of this Court in the case<br />
of Printers (Mysore) Ltd. v. Assistant Commercial Tax<br />
Officer [(1994) 93 Sales Tax Cases 95 : (1994) 2 SCC<br />
434], Whirlpool Corporation v. Registrar of Trade<br />
Marks [(1998) 8 SCC 1] as well as the judgment in the<br />
case of State of H.P. &#038; Ors. v. Gujarat Ambuja Cements<br />
Ltd. [(2005) 6 SCC 499 : (2005) 142 Sales Tax Cases<br />
1], the writ petition was maintainable. However, while<br />
laying emphasis that the newspaper would not fall<br />
within the expression `goods&#8217; under sub-section 3 of<br />
Section 5 of the Act, the High Court held that the notice<br />
issued was proper as Form No. 18 which gives benefit<br />
of concessional rate of tax was factually not correct.<br />
While dismissing the writ petition, however, the Bench<br />
issued a direction to the assessing authority to examine<br />
whether the imposition of penalty at double the rate is<br />
justified in the facts and circumstances of the case,<br />
within a period of two months from the date of receipt<br />
of the copy of the judgment. It is this judgment of the<br />
High Court which has been assailed in the present<br />
appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution of India.<br />
9. Having heard the learned senior counsel appearing<br />
for the parties, we are of the considered view that the<br />
order under challenge requires interference by this<br />
Court. There is no dispute to the fact that the material<br />
amendments were carried out in the provisions<br />
of Section 5(3) of the Act with effect from 01.04.2002.<br />
The existing 1st proviso to Section 5(3)(i) was deleted<br />
as well as the expression `or uses the same in the<br />
manufacture of any goods which are not liable to tax in<br />
this Act&#8217; in Section 5(3)(i) was also deleted. Despite<br />
these amendments, as it appears from the record<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(50 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
before the Court, format of Form No. 18 has not been<br />
amended consequently. However, the fact of<br />
thematter remains that the High Court has not<br />
dwelt upon these legal issues which are the core<br />
issues involved in the present case. In our view,<br />
the discussion on the first issue would certainly<br />
have some bearing on the alternative argument<br />
raised on behalf of the appellant before us. Thus,<br />
it may not be possible for this Court to sustain<br />
the finding recorded by the High Court in that<br />
regard. Of course, we are not ruling out all the<br />
possibilities of the High Court arriving at the<br />
same conclusion if it is of that view after<br />
examining the amendments as well as the<br />
submissions made on behalf of the appellant with<br />
regard to its alternative submissions. In light of<br />
this discussion, we pass the following order :<br />
(a) The impugned order dated 2nd August,<br />
2006 passed by the High Court is hereby<br />
set aside.<br />
(b) The matter is remanded to the High<br />
Court for consideration afresh in<br />
accordance with law on both the aforesaid<br />
submissions while leaving all the<br />
contentions of the assessee and the<br />
Department open for the year 2000- 2001,<br />
in relation to imposition of penalty<br />
under Section 45 (A) of the Act.<br />
(c) The legality and validity or otherwise of the<br />
notice dated 16.01.2006 and 17.01.2006 shall be<br />
subject to the final decision of the High Court.<br />
28. Applying the principle deducible from the opinions supra, to<br />
the preliminary objections raised by the learned senior counsel for<br />
the respondents, as to maintainability of the writ applications;<br />
merits rejection, and is, hereby rejected.<br />
29. Indisputably, in all the writ applications constituting the<br />
batch; the alleged benami transactions are of a date preceding 1st<br />
November, 2016. In some of the matters, even prior to the<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(51 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
commencement of unamended Benami Act of 1988, which came<br />
into effect on 5th September, 1988 whereas Sections 3, 5 and 8 of<br />
the unamended Benami Act, 1988, were deemed to have come<br />
into force on 19th day of May, 1988 i.e with retrospective effect.<br />
The Benami Amendment Act, 2016 (43 of 2016), has been made<br />
applicable from the date appointed by the Central Government<br />
vide notification dated 25th October, 2016. And the appointed date<br />
determined, is, 1st November, 2016, as the date on which the<br />
provisions of the Benami Amendment Act, 2016, shall come into<br />
force.<br />
30. A comparative consideration of Section 2 of the Benami Act,<br />
1988 and the Benami Amendment Act, 2016, would reflect that<br />
the definitions under the unamended Act contains sub-section (1)<br />
to (4) only, whereas the amending Benami Amendment Act, 2016,<br />
contains sub-section (1) to (31), defining various terms and<br />
phrases elaborately. Learned counsel for the parties referring to<br />
the aims, objects and scope of amendment in the Principal Act of<br />
1988 vide Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act,<br />
2016, contended that while the earlier unamended Benami Act,<br />
1988, consisted of only 9 Sections, the Benami Amendment Act,<br />
2016, consisted of as many as 72 Sections.<br />
31. However, the unamended Benami Act of 1988, for the first<br />
time contemplated prohibition of benami transactions vide Section<br />
3. Section 4 prohibited right to recover property held benami.<br />
Section 5 contemplated properties held benami subject to<br />
acquisition by such authority in such manner and following such<br />
procedure as may be prescribed; without payment of any amount<br />
for acquisition of any property that was held benami. The<br />

(52 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
unamended Benami Act, 1988, vested the Central Government<br />
with the power to frame rules for carrying out the purpose of the<br />
Benami Act, 1988, by notification in the official gazette. Since no<br />
rules were framed by the Central Government in exercise of<br />
powers under Section 8 of the unamended Benami Act, 1988, for<br />
acquisition of properties held benami; no property was acquired<br />
despite the unamended Benami Act of 1988, remained in force all<br />
along until amnedments interoduced in the year 2016.<br />
Admittedly, the unamended Benami Act, of 1988, did not contain<br />
any specific provision for vesting of benami property with<br />
Central Government. Furthermore, there was no provision for an<br />
appellate mechanism against action taken by the authorities under<br />
the unamended the Benami Act, 1988 while barring the<br />
jurisdiction of Civil Court. No powers with the authorities<br />
concerned for its implementation. However, in order to deal with<br />
the benami transactions involving large amounts of unaccounted<br />
black money, a mechanism has been introduced to make operative<br />
the intention and object of the unamended Benami Act of 1988 by<br />
the Benami Amendment Act, 2016; is the plea in support of its<br />
retrospective applicability of amended the Benami Act, 1988<br />
through the Benami Amendment Act, 2016.<br />
32. In order to appreciate the rival contentions of the parties on<br />
the question for determination, it will be profitable to take note of<br />
the relevant provisions of the unamended Benami Act of 1988 so<br />
also the relevant provisions of the Benami Amendment Act, 2016<br />

(63 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
33. From a glance of notification dated 25th October, 2016, it is<br />
evident that Central Government, in exercise of powers conferred<br />
by Section 68 of the Benami Amendment Act, 2016; has framed<br />
the rules and made them effective w.e.f. 1st November, 2016, i.e.<br />
the date from which the Benami Amendment Act, 2016, has been<br />
enacted. Thus, it is evident that the Central Government exercised<br />
the powers, to frame the rules, conferred by virtue of Section 68,<br />
introduced vide Benami Amendment Act, 2016, which itself came<br />
into effect from the appointed date i.e. 1st November, 2016.<br />
Hence, the rules framed, in exercise of power under Section 68,<br />
have been framed and notified by notification dated 25th October,<br />
2016, even before the amendement incorporating Section 68, was<br />
made operative that is w.e.f. 1st November, 2016. Therefore, the<br />
plea of the petitioners as to the rules having been framed contrary<br />
to and in absence of power available to the Central Government<br />
under Section 68 of the Benami Amendment Act, 2016, which was<br />
made operative and effective w.e.f. 1st November, 2016; has<br />
substance.<br />
34. Further, to understand the true character and meaning of<br />
Benami Transactions, under the English law and Indian Law; it will<br />
be relevant to take note of the text of para 14 of the Apex Court<br />
of the land in the case of Thakur Bhim Singh (dead) By Lrs<br />
and Ors. (supra), which reads thus:<br />
“14. Under the English law, when real or personal<br />
property is purchased in the name of a stranger, a<br />
resulting trust will be presumed in favour of the person<br />
who is proved to have paid the purchase money in the<br />
character of the purchaser. It is, however, open to the<br />
transferee to rebut that presumption by showing that<br />

(64 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
purchase money was that the transferee should himself<br />
acquire the beneficial interest in the property. There is,<br />
however, an exception to the above rule of presumption<br />
made by the English law when the person who gets the<br />
legal title under the conveyance is either a child or the<br />
wife of the person who contributes the purchase money<br />
or his grand child, whose father is dead. The rule<br />
applicable in such cases is known as the doctrine of<br />
advancement which requires the court to presume that<br />
the purchase is for the benefit of the person in whose<br />
favour the legal title is transferred even though the<br />
purchase money may have been contributed by the<br />
father or the husband or the grandfather, as the case<br />
may be, unless such presumption is rebutted by<br />
evidence showing that it was the intention of the<br />
person who paid the purchase money that the<br />
transferee should not become the real owner of the<br />
property in question. The doctrine of advancement is<br />
not in vogue in India. The counterpart of the English<br />
law of resulting trust referred to above is the Indian law<br />
of benami transactions. Two kinds of benami<br />
transactions are generally recognized in India. Where a<br />
person buys a property with his own money but in the<br />
name of another person without any intention to<br />
benefit such other person, the transaction is called<br />
benami. In that case, the transferee holds the property<br />
for the benefit of the person who has contributed the<br />
purchase money, and he is the real owner. The second<br />
case which is loosely termed as a benami transaction is<br />
a case where a person who is the owner of the property<br />
executes a conveyance in favour of another without the<br />
intention of transferring the title to the property<br />
thereunder. In this case, the transferor continues to be<br />
the real owner. The difference between the two kinds of<br />
benami transactions referred to above lies in the fact<br />
that whereas in the former case, there is an operative<br />
transfer from the transferor to the transferee though<br />
the transferee holds the property for the benefit of the<br />
person who has contributed the purchase money, in the<br />
latter case, there is no operative transfer at all and the<br />
title rests with the transferor notwithstanding the<br />
execution of the conveyance. One common feature,<br />
however, in both these cases is that the real title is<br />
divorced from the ostensible title and they are vested<br />
in different persons. The question whether a<br />
transaction is a benami transaction or not mainly<br />
depends upon the intention of the person who has<br />
contributed the purchase money in the former case and<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(65 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
upon the intention of the person who has executed the<br />
conveyance in the latter case. The principle underlying<br />
the former case is also statutorily recognized in Section<br />
82 of the Indian Trusts Act, 1882 which provides that<br />
where property is transferred to one person for a<br />
consideration paid or provided by another person and it<br />
appears that such other person did not intend to pay or<br />
provide such consideration for the benefit of the<br />
transferee, the transferee must hold the property for<br />
the benefit of the person paying or providing the<br />
consideration. This view is in accord with the following<br />
observations made by this Court in Meenakshi Mills.<br />
Madurai v. The Commissioner of Income-Tax, Madras<br />
MANU/SC/0044/1956 : [1956]1SCR691 .:<br />
In this connection, it is necessary to note that the word<br />
&#8216;benami&#8217; is used to denote two classes of transactions<br />
which differ from each other in their legal character and<br />
incidents. In one sense, it signifies a transaction which<br />
is real, as for example when A sells properties to B but<br />
the sale deed mentions X as the purchaser. Here the<br />
sale itself is genuine, but the real purchaser is B, X<br />
being his benamidar. This is the class of transactions<br />
which is usually termed as benami. But the word<br />
&#8216;benami&#8217; is also occasionally used, perhaps not quite<br />
accurately, to refer to a sham transaction, as for<br />
example, when A purports to sell his property to B<br />
without intending that his title should cease or pass to<br />
B. The fundamental difference between these two<br />
classes of transactions is that whereas in the former<br />
there is an operative transfer resulting in the vesting of<br />
title in the transferee, in the latter there is none such,<br />
the transferor continuing to retain the title<br />
notwithstanding the execution of the transfer deed. It is<br />
only in the former class of cases that it would be<br />
necessary, when a dispute arises as to whether the<br />
person named in the deed is the real transferee or B, to<br />
enquire into the question as to who paid the<br />
consideration for the transfer, X or B. But in the latter<br />
class of cases, when the question is whether the<br />
transfer is genuine or sham, the point for decision<br />
would be, not who paid the consideration but whether<br />
any consideration was paid.”<br />
35. In the case of Calcutta Discount Company Limited (supra),<br />
Supreme Court, held thus:<br />

(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(66 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
6. To confer jurisdiction under this section to issue<br />
notice in respect of assessments beyond the period of<br />
four years, but within a period of eight years, from the<br />
end of the relevant year two conditions have therefore<br />
to be satisfied. The first is that the Income-tax Officer<br />
must have reason to believe that income, profits or<br />
gains chargeable to income-tax have been underassessed.<br />
The second is that he must have also reason<br />
to believe that such &#8220;under assessment&#8221; has occurred<br />
by reason of either (i) omission or failure on the part of<br />
an assessee to make a return of his income under<br />
section 22, or (ii) omission or failure on the part of an<br />
assessee to disclose fully and truly and all material<br />
facts necessary for his assessment for that year. Both<br />
these conditions are conditions precedent to be<br />
satisfied before the Income-tax Officer could have<br />
jurisdiction to issue a notice for the assessment or<br />
reassessment beyond the period of four years but<br />
within the period of eight years, from the end of the<br />
year in question.<br />
24. We are therefore bound to hold that the conditions<br />
precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction under section<br />
34 of the Income-tax Act did not exist and the Incometax<br />
Officer had therefore no jurisdiction to issue the<br />
impugned notices under section 34 in respect of the<br />
years 1942-43, 1943-44 and 1944-45 after the expiry<br />
of four years.<br />
25. Mr. Sastri argued that the question whether the<br />
Income-tax Officer had reason to believe that underassessment<br />
had occurred &#8220;by reason of non-disclosure<br />
of material facts&#8221; should not be investigated by the<br />
courts in an application under article 226. Learned<br />
Counsel seems to suggest that as soon as the Incometax<br />
Officer has reason to believe that there has been<br />
under-assessment in any year he has jurisdiction to<br />
start proceedings under section 34 by issuing a notice<br />
provided 8 years have not elapsed from the end of the<br />
year in question, but whether the notices should have<br />
been issued within a period of 4 years or not is only a<br />
question of limitation which could and should properly<br />
be raised in the assessment proceedings. It is wholly<br />
incorrect however to suppose that this is a question of<br />
limitation only not touching the question of jurisdiction.<br />
The scheme of the law clearly is that where the<br />
Income-tax Officer has reason to believe that an under<br />
assessment has resulted from non-disclosure he shall<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(67 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
have jurisdiction to start proceedings for re-assessment<br />
within a period of 8 years; and where he has reason to<br />
believe that an under assessment has resulted from<br />
other causes he shall have jurisdiction to start<br />
proceedings for reassessment within 4 years. Both the<br />
conditions, (i) the Income-tax Officer having reason to<br />
believe that there has been under assessment and (ii)<br />
his having reason to believe that such under<br />
assessment has resulted from non-disclosure of<br />
material facts, must co-exist before the Income-tax<br />
Officer has jurisdiction to start proceedings after the<br />
expiry of 4 years. The argument that the Court ought<br />
not to investigate the existence of one of these<br />
conditions, viz., that the Income-tax Officer has reason<br />
to believe that under assessment has resulted from<br />
non-disclosure of material facts cannot therefore be<br />
accepted.<br />
26. Mr. Sastri next pointed out that at the stage when<br />
the Income-tax Officer issued the notices he was not<br />
acting judicially or quasi-judicially and so a writ of<br />
certiorari or prohibition cannot issue.<br />
It is well settled however that though the writ of<br />
prohibition or certiorari will not issue against an<br />
executive authority, the High Courts have power to<br />
issue in a fit case an order prohibiting an executive<br />
authority from acting without jurisdiction. Where such<br />
action of an executive authority from acting without<br />
jurisdiction subjects or is likely to subject a person to<br />
lengthy proceedings and unnecessary harassment, the<br />
High Courts, it is well settled, will issue appropriate<br />
orders or directions to prevent such consequences.<br />
27. Mr. Sastri mentioned more than once the fact that<br />
the company would have sufficient opportunity to raise<br />
this question, viz., whether the Income-tax Officer had<br />
reason to believe that under assessment had resulted<br />
from non-disclosure of material facts, before the<br />
Income-tax Officer himself in the assessment<br />
proceedings and, if unsuccessful there, before the<br />
appellate Officer or the appellate tribunal or in the High<br />
Court under section 66(2) of the Indian Income-tax Act.<br />
The existence of such alternative remedy is not however<br />
always a sufficient reason for refusing a party quick<br />
relief by a writ or order prohibiting an authority acting<br />
without jurisdiction from continuing such action.<br />
28. In the present case the company contends that the<br />
conditions precedent for the assumption of jurisdiction<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(68 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
under section 34 were not satisfied and came to the<br />
court at the earliest opportunity. There is nothing in its<br />
conduct which would justify the refusal of proper relief<br />
under article 226. When the Constitution confers on the<br />
High Courts the power to give relief it becomes the duty<br />
of the courts to give such relief in fit cases and the<br />
courts would be failing to perform their duty if relief is<br />
refused without adequate reasons. In the present case<br />
we can find no reason for which relief should be refused.<br />
29. We have therefore come to the conclusion that the<br />
company was entitled to an order directing the Incometax<br />
Officer not to take any action on the basis of the<br />
three impugned notices.<br />
30. We are informed that assessment orders were in<br />
fact made on March 25, 1952, by the Income-tax Officer<br />
in the proceedings started on the basis of these<br />
impugned notices. This was done with the permission of<br />
the learned Judge before whom the petition under<br />
article 226 was pending, on the distinct understanding<br />
that these orders would be without prejudice to the<br />
contentions of the parties on the several questions<br />
raised in the petition and without prejudice to the orders<br />
that may ultimately be passed by the Court. The fact<br />
that the assessment orders have already been made<br />
does not therefore affect the company&#8217;s right to obtain<br />
relief under article 226. In view however of the fact that<br />
the assessment orders have already been made we<br />
think it proper that in addition to an order directing the<br />
Income-tax Officer not to take any action on the basis<br />
of the impugned notices a further order quashing the<br />
assessment made be also issued.<br />
36. In the case of Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Vatika<br />
Township Private Limited (supra), the Supreme Court,<br />
observed thus:<br />
27. A legislation, be it a statutory Act or a statutory<br />
Rule or a statutory Notification, may physically consists<br />
of words printed on papers. However, conceptually it is<br />
a great deal more than an ordinary prose. There is a<br />
special peculiarity in the mode of verbal communication<br />
by a legislation. A legislation is not just a series of<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(69 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
statements, such as one finds in a work of fiction/non<br />
fiction or even in a judgment of a court of law. There is<br />
a technique required to draft a legislation as well as to<br />
understand a legislation. Former technique is known as<br />
legislative drafting and latter one is to be found in the<br />
various principles of &#8216;Interpretation of Statutes&#8217;. Vis-àvis<br />
ordinary prose, a legislation differs in its<br />
provenance, lay-out and features as also in the<br />
implication as to its meaning that arise by presumptions<br />
as to the intent of the maker thereof.<br />
28. Of the various rules guiding how a legislation has to<br />
be interpreted, one established rule is that unless a<br />
contrary intention appears, a legislation is presumed not<br />
to be intended to have a retrospective operation. The<br />
idea behind the rule is that a current law should govern<br />
current activities. Law passed today cannot apply to the<br />
events of the past. If we do something today, we do it<br />
keeping in view the law of today and in force and not<br />
tomorrow&#8217;s backward adjustment of it. Our belief in the<br />
nature of the law is founded on the bed rock that every<br />
human being is entitled to arrange his affairs by relying<br />
on the existing law and should not find that his plans<br />
have been retrospectively upset. This principle of law is<br />
known as lex prospicit non respicit: law looks forward<br />
not backward. As was observed in Phillips v. Eyre<br />
(1870) LR 6 QB 1, a retrospective legislation is contrary<br />
to the general principle that legislation by which the<br />
conduct of mankind is to be regulated when introduced<br />
for the first time to deal with future acts ought not to<br />
change the character of past transactions carried on<br />
upon the faith of the then existing law.<br />
29. The obvious basis of the principle against<br />
retrospectivity is the principle of &#8216;fairness&#8217;, which must<br />
be the basis of every legal rule as was observed in the<br />
decision reported in L&#8217;Office Cherifien des Phosphates v.<br />
Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co. Ltd. (1994) 1 AC<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(70 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
486. Thus, legislations which modified accrued rights or<br />
which impose obligations or impose new duties or<br />
attach a new disability have to be treated as prospective<br />
unless the legislative intent is clearly to give the<br />
enactment a retrospective effect; unless the legislation<br />
is for purpose of supplying an obvious omission in a<br />
former legislation or to explain a former legislation. We<br />
need not note the cornucopia of case law available on<br />
the subject because aforesaid legal position clearly<br />
emerges from the various decisions and this legal<br />
position was conceded by the counsel for the parties.<br />
In any case, we shall refer to few judgments containing<br />
this dicta, a little later.<br />
32. Let us sharpen the discussion a little more. We may<br />
note that under certain circumstances, a particular<br />
amendment can be treated as clarificatory or<br />
declaratory in nature. Such statutory provisions are<br />
labeled as &#8220;declaratory statutes&#8221;. The circumstances<br />
under which a provision can be termed as &#8220;declaratory<br />
statutes&#8221; is explained by Justice G.P. Singh in the<br />
following manner:<br />
“Declaratory statutes<br />
The presumption against retrospective operation is not<br />
applicable to declaratory statutes. As stated in CRAIES<br />
and approved by the Supreme Court: &#8220;For modern<br />
purposes a declaratory Act may be defined as an Act to<br />
remove doubts existing as to the common law, or the<br />
meaning or effect of any statute. Such Acts are usually<br />
held to be retrospective. The usual reason for passing a<br />
declaratory Act is to set aside what Parliament deems to<br />
have been a judicial error, whether in the statement of<br />
the common law or in the interpretation of statutes.<br />
Usually, if not invariably, such an Act contains a<br />
preamble, and also the word &#8216;declared&#8217; as well as the<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(71 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
word &#8216;enacted&#8217;. But the use of the words &#8216;it is declared&#8217;<br />
is not conclusive that the Act is declaratory for these<br />
words may, at times, be used to introduced new rules of<br />
law and the Act in the latter case will only be amending<br />
the law and will not necessarily be retrospective. In<br />
determining, therefore, the nature of the Act, regard<br />
must be had to the substance rather than to the form. If<br />
a new Act is &#8216;to explain&#8217; an earlier Act, it would be<br />
without object unless construed retrospective. An<br />
explanatory Act is generally passed to supply an obvious<br />
omission or to clear up doubts as to the meaning of the<br />
previous Act. It is well settled that if a statute is<br />
curative or merely declaratory of the previous law<br />
retrospective operation is generally intended. The<br />
language &#8216;shall be deemed always to have meant&#8217; is<br />
declaratory, and is in plain terms retrospective. In the<br />
absence of clear words indicating that the amending Act<br />
is declaratory, it would not be so construed when the<br />
pre-amended provision was clear and unambiguous. An<br />
amending Act may be purely clarificatory to clear a<br />
meaning of a provision of the principal Act which was<br />
already implicit. A clarificatory amendment of this<br />
nature will have retrospective effect and, therefore, if<br />
the principal Act was existing law which the Constitution<br />
came into force, the amending Act also will be part of<br />
the existing law.<br />
The above summing up is factually based on the<br />
judgments of this Court as well as English decisions.<br />
37. When we examine the insertion of proviso in Section<br />
113 of the Act, keeping in view the aforesaid principles,<br />
our irresistible conclusion is that the intention of the<br />
legislature was to make it prospective in nature. This<br />
proviso cannot be treated as declaratory/statutory or<br />
curative in nature.<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(72 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
42.2 Thus, it was a conscious decision of the<br />
legislature, even when the legislature knew the<br />
implication thereof and took note of the reasons which<br />
led to the insertion of the proviso, that the amendment<br />
is to operate prospectively. Learned Counsel appearing<br />
for the Assessees sagaciously contrasted the aforesaid<br />
stipulation while effecting amendment in Section 113 of<br />
the Act, with various other provisions not only in the<br />
same Finance Act but Finance Acts pertaining to other<br />
years where the legislature specifically provided such<br />
amendment to be either retrospective or clarificatory.<br />
In so far as amendment to Section 113 is concerned,<br />
there is no such language used and on the contrary,<br />
specific stipulation is added making the provision<br />
effective from 1st June, 2002.<br />
44. Finance Act, 2003, again makes the position clear<br />
that surcharge in respect of block assessment of<br />
undisclosed income was made prospective. Such a<br />
stipulation is contained in second proviso to Subsection<br />
(3) of Section 2 of Finance Act, 2003. This<br />
proviso reads as under:<br />
“Provided further that the amount of incometax<br />
computed in accordance with the<br />
provisions of Section 113 shall be increased<br />
by a surcharge for purposes of the Union as<br />
provided in Paragraph A, B, C, D or E, as the<br />
case may be, of Part III of the First Schedule<br />
of the Finance Act of the year in which the<br />
search is initiated Under Section 132 or<br />
requisition is made Under Section 132A of<br />
the income-tax Act.”<br />
Addition of this proviso in the Finance Act, 2003 further<br />
makes it clear that such a provision was necessary to<br />
provide for surcharge in the cases of block assessments<br />
and thereby making it prospective in nature. The charge<br />
in respect of the surcharge, having been created for the<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(73 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
first time by the insertion of the proviso to Section 113,<br />
is clearly a substantive provision and hence is to be<br />
construed prospective in operation. The amendment<br />
neither purports to be merely clarificatory nor is there<br />
any material to suggest that it was intended by<br />
Parliament. Furthermore, an amendment made to a<br />
taxing statute can be said to be intended to remove<br />
&#8216;hardships&#8217; only of the Assessee, not of the Department.<br />
On the contrary, imposing a retrospective levy on the<br />
Assessee would have caused undue hardship and for<br />
that reason Parliament specifically chose to make the<br />
proviso effective from 1.6.2002.<br />
37. In the case of Commissioner of Prakash and Ors. vs.<br />
Phulavati and Ors. (supra), the Apex Court of the land, held thus:<br />
17. The text of the amendment itself clearly provides<br />
that the right conferred on a &#8216;daughter of a coparcener&#8217;<br />
is &#8216;on and from the commencement of Hindu<br />
Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005&#8217;. Section 6(3) talks<br />
of death after the amendment for its applicability. In<br />
view of plain language of the statute, there is no scope<br />
for a different interpretation than the one suggested by<br />
the text of the amendment. An amendment of a<br />
substantive provision is always prospective unless<br />
either expressly or by necessary intendment it is<br />
retrospective Shyam Sunder v. Ram Kumar (2001) 8<br />
SCC 24, Paras 22 to 27. In the present case, there is<br />
neither any express provision for giving retrospective<br />
effect to the amended provision nor necessary<br />
intendment to that effect. Requirement of partition<br />
being registered can have no application to statutory<br />
notional partition on opening of succession as per<br />
unamended provision, having regard to nature of such<br />
partition which is by operation of law. The intent and<br />
effect of the Amendment will be considered a little<br />
later. On this finding, the view of the High Court cannot<br />
be sustained.<br />
18. Contention of the Respondents that the<br />
Amendment should be read as retrospective being a<br />
piece of social legislation cannot be accepted. Even a<br />
social legislation cannot be given retrospective effect<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(74 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
unless so provided for or so intended by the legislature.<br />
In the present case, the legislature has expressly made<br />
the Amendment applicable on and from its<br />
commencement and only if death of the coparcener in<br />
question is after the Amendment. Thus, no other<br />
interpretation is possible in view of express language of<br />
the statute. The proviso keeping dispositions or<br />
alienations or partitions prior to 20th December, 2004<br />
unaffected can also not lead to the inference that the<br />
daughter could be a coparcener prior to the<br />
commencement of the Act. The proviso only means<br />
that the transactions not covered thereby will not affect<br />
the extent of coparcenary property which may be<br />
available when the main provision is applicable.<br />
Similarly, Explanation has to be read harmoniously with<br />
the substantive provision of Section 6(5) by being<br />
limited to a transaction of partition effected after 20th<br />
December, 2004. Notional partition, by its very nature,<br />
is not covered either under proviso or under Subsection<br />
5 or under the Explanation.<br />
38. In the case of Sukhdev Singh vs. State of Haryana:<br />
(supra), the Supreme Court, observed thus:<br />
“Another Bench of this Court in the case of Jawahar<br />
Singh @ Bhagat Ji. v. State of GNCT of Delhi (2009) 6<br />
SCC 490], while dealing with the amendments of<br />
Section 21 of the NDPS Act, the Court took the view<br />
that amendments made by Act 9 of 2001 could not be<br />
given retrospective effect as if it was so given, it would<br />
warrant a retrial which is not the object of the Act. The<br />
Court held as under:<br />
“9. It is now beyond any doubt or dispute<br />
that the quantum of punishment to be<br />
inflicted on an accused upon recording a<br />
judgment of conviction would be as per the<br />
law which was prevailing at the relevant<br />
time. As on the date of commission of the<br />
offence and/or the date of conviction, there<br />
was no distinction between a small<br />
quantity and a commercial quantity,<br />
question of infliction of a lesser sentence<br />
by reason of the provisions of the<br />
amending Act, in our considered opinion,<br />
would not arise.<br />
10. It is also a well-settled principle of law<br />
that a substantive provision unless<br />

specifically provided for or otherwise<br />
intended by Parliament should be held to<br />
have a prospective operation. One of the<br />
facets of the rule of law is also that all<br />
statutes should be presumed to have a<br />
prospective operation only.”<br />
18. No law can be interpreted so as to frustrate the<br />
very basic rule of law. It is a settled principle of<br />
interpretation of criminal jurisprudence that the<br />
provisions have to be strictly construed and cannot be<br />
given a retrospective effect unless legislative intent and<br />
expression is clear beyond ambiguity. The amendments<br />
to criminal law would not intend that there should be<br />
undue delay in disposal of criminal trials or there<br />
should be retrial just because the law has changed.<br />
Such an approach would be contrary to the doctrine of<br />
finality as well as avoidance of delay in conclusion of<br />
criminal trial.”<br />
39. In the case of J.S. Yadav vs. State of U.P. and Ors.<br />
(supra), the Supreme Court held thus:<br />
24. The Legislature is competent to unilaterally alter<br />
the service conditions of the employee and that can be<br />
done with retrospective effect also, but the intention of<br />
the Legislature to apply the amended provisions with<br />
retrospective effect must be evident from the<br />
Amendment Act itself expressly or by necessary<br />
implication. The aforesaid power of the Legislature is<br />
qualified further that such a unilateral alteration of<br />
service conditions should be in conformity with legal<br />
and constitutional provisions. Roshan Lal Tandon v.<br />

25. In Union of India and Ors. v. Tushar Ranjan<br />
Mohanty and Ors. (1994) 5 SCC 450, this Court<br />
declared the amendment with retrospective operation<br />
as ultra vires as it takes away the vested rights of the<br />
Petitioners therein and thus, was unreasonable,<br />
arbitrary and violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the<br />
Constitution. While deciding the said case, this Court<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(76 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
placed very heavy reliance on the judgment in P.D.<br />
Aggarwal and Ors. v. State of U.P. and Ors.AIR 1987 SC<br />
1676, wherein this Court has held as under:<br />
“18. &#8230;the Government has power to make<br />
retrospective amendments to the Rules but<br />
if the Rules purport to take away the<br />
vested rights and are arbitrary and not<br />
reasonable then such retrospective<br />
amendments are subject to judicial<br />
scrutiny if they have infringed Articles 14<br />
and 16 of the Constitution.”<br />
40. In the case of Shakti Tubes Ltd. vs. State of Bihar and<br />
Ors.:(supra), the Apex Court of the land observed thus:<br />
“24. Generally, an Act should always be regarded as<br />
prospective in nature unless the legislature has clearly<br />
intended the provisions of the said Act to be made<br />
applicable with retrospective effect.<br />
“13. It is a cardinal principle of construction<br />
that every statute is prima facie prospective<br />
unless it is expressly or by necessary<br />
implication made to have a retrospective<br />
operation. The aforesaid rule in general is<br />
applicable where the object of the statute is<br />
to affect vested rights or to impose new<br />
burdens or to impair existing obligations.<br />
Unless there are words in the statute<br />
sufficient to show the intention of the<br />
legislature to affect existing rights, it is<br />
deemed to be prospective only &#8212; &#8220;nova<br />
Constitution futuris formam imponere debet<br />
non praeteritis&#8221; &#8212; a new law ought to<br />
regulate what is to follow, not the past.<br />
(See Principles of Statutory Interpretation<br />
by Justice G.P. Singh, 9th Edn., 2004 at p.<br />
438.). It is not necessary that an express<br />
provision be made to make a statute<br />
retrospective and the presumption against<br />
retrospectivity may be rebutted by<br />
necessary implication especially in a case<br />
where the new law is made to cure an<br />
acknowledged evil for the benefit of the<br />
community as a whole (ibid., p. 440).<br />

(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(77 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
25. There is no dispute with regard to the fact that the<br />
Act in question is a welfare legislation which was<br />
enacted to protect the interest of the suppliers<br />
especially suppliers of the nature of a small scale<br />
industry. But, at the same time, the intention and the<br />
purpose of the Act cannot be lost sight of and the Act in<br />
question cannot be given a retrospective effect so long<br />
as such an intention is not clearly made out and<br />
derived from the Act itself.”<br />
41. In the case of O. Konavalov vs. Commander, Coast<br />
Guard Region and Ors.: (supra), the Supreme Court observed<br />
thus:<br />
“POWER TO CONFISCATE<br />
30. The power to confiscate and the consequent<br />
forfeiture of rights or interests are drastic, being penal<br />
in nature. Statutes conferring such powers must be<br />
read very strictly. There can be no exercise of power<br />
under such statutes by way of extension or implication.<br />
No expansive meaning can be given therefore to<br />
Section 115 of the Customs Act merely from the<br />
dictionary meaning the word absolute as has been done<br />
by the Division Bench of the High Court.<br />
42. In the case of M/S Pepsi Foods Ltd. and Ors. vs. Special<br />
Judicial Magistrate and Ors.(supra), the Supreme Court held<br />
thus:<br />
“29. No doubt the magistrate can discharge the<br />
accused at any stage of the trial if he considers the<br />
charge to be groundless, but that does not mean that<br />
the accused cannot approach the High Court under<br />
Section 482 of the Code or Article 227 of the<br />
Constitution to have the proceeding quashed against<br />
him when the complaint does not make out any case<br />
against him and still he must undergo the agony of a<br />
criminal trial. It was submitted before us on behalf of<br />
the State that in case we find that the High Court failed<br />
to exercise its jurisdiction the matter should be<br />
remanded back to it to consider if the complaint and<br />
the evidence on record did not make out any case<br />
against the appellants. If, however, we refer to the<br />
impugned judgment of the High Court it has come to<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(78 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
the conclusion, though without referring to any<br />
material on record, that &#8220;in the present case it cannot<br />
be said at this stage that the allegations in the<br />
complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on<br />
the basis of which no prudent man can ever reach a<br />
just conclusion that there exists no sufficient ground for<br />
proceedings against the accused.&#8221; We do not think that<br />
the High Court was correct in coming to such a<br />
conclusion and in coming to that it has also foreclosed<br />
the matter for the magistrate as well, as the magistrate<br />
will not give any different conclusion on an application<br />
filed under Section 245 of the Code. The High Court<br />
says that the appellants could very well appear before<br />
the court and move an application under Section<br />
245(2) of the Code and that the magistrate could<br />
discharge them if he found the charge to be groundless<br />
and at the same time it has itself returned the finding<br />
that there are sufficient grounds for proceeding against<br />
the appellants. If we now refer to the facts of the case<br />
before us it is clear to us that not only that allegations<br />
against the appellants do not make out any case for an<br />
offence under Section 7 of the Act and also that there<br />
is no basis for the complainant to make such<br />
allegations. The allegations in the complaint merely<br />
show that the appellants have given their brand name<br />
to &#8220;Residency Foods and Beverages Ltd.&#8221; for bottling<br />
the beverage &#8220;Lehar Pepsi &#8216;. The complaint does not<br />
show what is the role of the appellants in the<br />
manufacture of the beverage which is said to be<br />
adulterated. The only allegation is that the appellants<br />
are the manufacturer of bottle. There is no averment as<br />
to how the complainant could say so and also if the<br />
appellants manufactured the alleged bottle or its<br />
contents. His sole information is from A.K. Jain who is<br />
impleaded as accused No. 3. The preliminary evidence<br />
on which the 1st respondent relied in issuing summon<br />
to the appellants also does not show as to how it could<br />
be said that the appellants are manufacturers of either<br />
the bottle or the beverage or both. There is another<br />
aspect of the matter. The Central Government in the<br />
exercise of their powers under Section 3 of the<br />
Essential Commodities Act, 1955 made Fruit Products<br />
Order, 1955 (for short, the &#8220;Fruit Order&#8221;). It is not<br />
disputed that the beverage in the question is a &#8220;fruit<br />
product&#8221; within the meaning of Clause (2)(b) of the<br />
Fruit Order and that for the manufacture thereof<br />
certain licence is required. The Fruit Order defines the<br />
manufacturer and also sets out as to what the<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(79 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
manufacturer is required to do in regard to the<br />
packaging, marking and labelling of containers of fruit<br />
products. One of such requirement is that when a<br />
bottle is used in packing any fruit products, it shall be<br />
so sealed that it cannot be opened without destroying<br />
the licence number and the special identification mark<br />
of the manufacturer to be displayed on the top or neck<br />
of the bottle. The licence number of manufacturer shall<br />
also be exhibited prominently on the side label on such<br />
bottle [Clause (8) (1) (b) ]. Admittedly, the name of<br />
the first appellant is not mentioned as a manufacturer<br />
on the top cap of the bottle. It is not necessary to refer<br />
in detail to other requirements of the Fruit Order and<br />
the consequences of infringement of the Order and to<br />
the penalty to which the manufacturer would be<br />
exposed under the provisions of the Essential<br />
Commodities Act, 1955. We may, however, note that in<br />
The Hamdard Dawakhana .(WAKF) Delhi and Anr. v.<br />
The Union of India and Ors.,[1965]2SCR192 , an<br />
argument was raised that the Fruit Order was invalid<br />
because its provision indicated that it was an Order<br />
which could have been appropriately issued under the<br />
Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954. This Court<br />
negatived this plea and said that the Fruit order was<br />
validly issued under the Essential Commodities Act.<br />
What we find in the present case is that there was<br />
nothing on record to show if the appellants held the<br />
licence for the manufacture of the offending beverage<br />
and if, as noted above, the first appellant was the<br />
manufacturer thereof.<br />
29. It is no comfortable thought for the appellants to<br />
be told that they could appear before the court which is<br />
at a far off place in the Ghazipur in the State of Uttar<br />
Pradesh, seek their release on bail and then to either<br />
move an application under Section 245(2) of the Code<br />
or to face trial when the complaint and the preliminary<br />
evidence recorded makes out no case against them. It<br />
is certainly one of those cases where there is an abuse<br />
of the process of the law and the courts and the High<br />
Court should not have shied away in exercising its<br />
jurisdiction. Provisions of Articles 226 and 227 of the<br />
Constitution and Section 482 of the Code are devised<br />
to advance justice and not to frustrate it. In our view<br />
High Court should not have adopted such a rigid<br />
approach which certainly has led to miscarriage of<br />
justice in the case. Power of judicial review is<br />

(80 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
discretionary but this was a case where the High Court<br />
should have exercised it.”<br />
43. In the case of Collector of Central Excise, Ahmedabad vs.<br />
Orient Fabrics Pvt. Ltd.: (supra) , the Apex Court of the land,<br />
held thus:<br />
“3. The Tribunal relying upon the decision in the case<br />
of Pioneer Silk Mills Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India,<br />
reported in 1995(80)ELT507(Del) , allowed the<br />
appeals, holding that the provisions of Central Excise<br />
Act and the Rules made thereunder, so far as they<br />
relate to confiscation cannot be made applicable for<br />
the breach of provisions of the Act. It is against the<br />
said judgment and order of the Tribunal, the appellant<br />
is in appeal before us.<br />
4. Mr. S.R. Bhat, learned counsel appearing for the<br />
appellant, urged that the view taken by the Tribunal in<br />
allowing the appeals was erroneous inasmuch as it is<br />
contrary to the decisions in the case of Khema &#038; Co.<br />
(Agencies) Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Maharashtra, reported<br />
in [1975]3SCR753 and Commissioner of Central Excise<br />
v. Ashok Fashion Ltd., reported in<br />
2002(141)ELT606(Guj).<br />
5. In order to appreciate the issue, it is relevant to set<br />
out the Sub-section (3) of Section 3 of the Act, as<br />
applicable in this matter and which runs as under:<br />
&#8220;SECTION 3: Levy and collection of<br />
additional duties:<br />
(1)..……………………………………………………<br />
(2)………………………………………………………<br />
(3) The provisions of the Central Excise and<br />
Salt Act, 1944 and the rules made<br />
thereunder including those relating to<br />
refunds and exemptions from duty shall, so<br />
far as may be apply in relation to the levy<br />
and collection of the additional duties as<br />
they apply in relation to the levy and<br />
collection of duties as they apply in relation<br />
to the levy and collection of the duties of<br />
excise on the goods specified in Sub-section<br />
(1).&#8221;<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(81 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
6. A perusal of the said provision shows that the breach<br />
of the provision of the Act has not been made penal or<br />
an offence and no power has been given to confiscate<br />
the goods. It only provides for application of the<br />
procedural provisions of the Central Excise and Salt<br />
Act, 1944 and the Rules made thereunder. It is no<br />
longer res integra that when the breach of the<br />
provisions of the Act is penal in nature or a penalty is<br />
imposed by way of additional tax, the constitutional<br />
mandate requires a clear authority of law for imposition<br />
for the same. Article 265 of the Constitution provides<br />
that no tax shall be levied or collected except by<br />
authority of law. The authority has to be specific and<br />
explicit and expressly provided. The Act created liability<br />
for additional duty for excise, but created no liability for<br />
any penalty. That being so, the confiscation<br />
proceedings against the respondents were unwarranted<br />
and without authority of law.<br />
7. The Parliament by reason of Section 63(a) of the<br />
Finance Act, 1994 (Act No. 32 of 1994) substituted<br />
Sub-section (3) of Section 3 of the said Act, which now<br />
reads as under:<br />
&#8220;3. Levy and collection of Additional<br />
Duties:-<br />
(1)………………………………………………………..<br />
(2)……………………………………………………….<br />
(3) The provisions of the [Central Excise<br />
Act, 1944] (1 of 1944), and the rules made<br />
thereunder, including those relating to<br />
refunds, exemptions from duty, offences<br />
and penalties, shall, so far as may be,<br />
apply in relation to the levy and collection<br />
of the additional duties as they apply in<br />
relation to the levy and collection of the<br />
duties of excise on the goods specified in<br />
Sub-section (1).&#8221;<br />
19. It is now a well settled principles of law that<br />
expropriatory legislation must be strictly construed (see<br />
D.L.F. Qutab Enclave Complex Educational Charitable<br />
Trust v. State of Haryana and Ors., reported in :<br />
[2003]2SCR1 ). It is further trite that a penal statute<br />
must receive strict construction.<br />
20. The matter may be considered from another angle.<br />
The Parliament by reason of the Amending Act 32 of<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(82 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
1994 consciously brought in the expression offences<br />
and penalties&#8217; in Sub-section (3) of Section 3 of the<br />
Act. The mischief rule, if applied, would clearly show<br />
that such amendment was brought with a view to<br />
remedy the defect contained in the unamended<br />
provisions of Sub-section (3) of Section 3 of the Act.<br />
Offences having regard to the provisions contained in<br />
Article 20 of the Constitution of India cannot be given a<br />
retrospective effect. In that view of the matter too Subsection<br />
(3) of Section 3 of the Act as amended cannot<br />
be said to have any application at all.<br />
21. In view of the aforesaid decisions, it must be held<br />
that the confiscation proceedings taken against the<br />
respondents and the penalty imposed upon them were<br />
totally without the authority of law and were rightly set<br />
aside by the Tribunal.”<br />
44. In the case of Suhas H. Pophale vs. Oriental Insurance<br />
Co. Ltd. and its Estate Officer: (supra) , the Supreme Court,<br />
held thus:<br />
“45. It has been laid down by this Court time and again<br />
that if there are rights created in favour of any person,<br />
whether they are property rights or rights arising from<br />
a transaction in the nature of a contract, and<br />
particularly if they are protected under a statute, and if<br />
they are to be taken away by any legislation, that<br />
legislation will have to say so specifically by giving it a<br />
retrospective effect. This is because prima facie every<br />
legislation is prospective (see para 7 of the Constitution<br />
Bench judgment in Janardan Reddy v. The State<br />
reported in AIR 1951 SC 124). In the instant case, the<br />
Appellant was undoubtedly protected as a &#8216;deemed<br />
tenant&#8217; under Section 15A of the Bombay Rent Act,<br />
prior to the merger of the erstwhile insurance company<br />
with a Government Company, and he could be removed<br />
only by following the procedure available under the<br />
Bombay Rent Act. A &#8216;deemed tenant&#8217; under the Bombay<br />
Rent Act, continued to be protected under the<br />
succeeding Act, in view of the definition of a &#8216;tenant&#8217;<br />
under Section 7(15)(a)(ii) of the Maharashtra Rent<br />
Control Act, 1999. Thus, as far as the tenants of the<br />
premises which are not covered under the Public<br />
Premises Act are concerned, those tenants who were<br />
deemed tenants under the Bombay Rent Act continued<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(83 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
to have their protection under the Maharashtra Rent<br />
Control Act, 1999. Should the coverage of their<br />
premises under the Public Premises Act make a<br />
difference to the tenants or occupants of such<br />
premises, and if so, from which date?<br />
46. It has been laid down by this Court through a<br />
number of judgments rendered over the years, that a<br />
legislation is not be given a retrospective effect unless<br />
specifically provided for, and not beyond the period that<br />
is provided therein. Thus, a Constitution Bench held in<br />
Garkiapati Veeraya v. N. Subbiah Choudhry reported in<br />
AIR 1957 SC 540 that in the absence of anything in the<br />
enactment to show that it is to be retrospective, it<br />
cannot be so constructed, as to have the effect of<br />
altering the law applicable to a claim in litigation at the<br />
time when the act was passed. In that matter, the<br />
Court was concerned with the issue as to whether the<br />
Appellant&#8217;s right to file an appeal continued to be<br />
available to him for filing an appeal to the Andhra<br />
Pradesh High Court after it was created from the<br />
erstwhile Madras High Court. The Constitution Bench<br />
held that the right very much survived, and the vested<br />
right of appeal can be taken away only by a subsequent<br />
enactment, if it so provides expressly or by necessary<br />
intendment and not otherwise.<br />
49. The same has been the view taken by a bench of<br />
three Judges of this Court in J.P. Jani, Income Tax<br />
Officer, Circle IV, Ward G, Ahmedabad v. Induprasad<br />
Devshanker Bhatt reported in AIR 1969 SC 778 in the<br />
context of a provision of the Income Tax Act, 1961, in<br />
the matter of reopening of assessment orders. In that<br />
matter the Court was concerned with the issue as to<br />
whether the Income Tax Officer could re-open the<br />
assessment under Section 297(2) (d)(ii) and 148 of the<br />
Income Tax Act, 1961, although the right to re-open<br />
was barred by that time under the earlier Income Tax<br />
Act, 1922. This Court held that the same was<br />
impermissible and observed in paragraph 5 as follows:<br />
5……The reason is that such a construction<br />
of Section 297(2)(d)(ii) would be<br />
tantamount to giving of retrospective<br />
operation to that section which is not<br />
warranted either by the express language<br />
of the section or by necessary implication.<br />
The principle is based on the well-known<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(84 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
rule of interpretation that unless the terms<br />
of the statute expressly so provide or<br />
unless there is a necessary implication,<br />
retrospective operation should not be given<br />
to the statute so as to affect, alter or<br />
destroy any right already acquired or to<br />
revive any remedy already lost by efflux of<br />
time.<br />
50. In Arjan Singh v. State of Punjab reported in AIR<br />
1970 SC 703, this Court was concerned with the issue<br />
of date of application of Section 32KK added into the<br />
Pepsu Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1955. This<br />
Court held in paragraph 4 thereof as follows:<br />
4. It is a well-settled rule of construction<br />
that no provision in a statute should be<br />
given retrospective effect unless the<br />
legislature by express terms or by<br />
necessary implication has made it<br />
retrospective and that where a provision is<br />
made retrospective, care should be taken<br />
not to extend its retrospective effect<br />
beyond what was intended.<br />
52. In the case of K.S. Paripoornan v. State of Kerala<br />
reported in AIR 1995 SC 1012, a Constitution Bench of<br />
this Court was concerned with the retrospective effect<br />
of Section 23(1A) introduced in the Land Acquisition<br />
Act. While dealing with this provision, this Court has<br />
observed as follows:<br />
64. A statute dealing with substantive<br />
rights differs from a statute which relates<br />
to procedure or evidence or is declaratory<br />
in nature inasmuch as while a statute<br />
dealing with substantive rights is prima<br />
facie prospective unless it is expressly or<br />
by necessary implication made to have<br />
retrospective effect, a statute concerned<br />
mainly with matters of procedure or<br />
evidence or which is declaratory in nature<br />
has to be construed as retrospective unless<br />
there is a clear indication that such was not<br />
the intention of the legislature. A statute is<br />
regarded retrospective if it operates on<br />
cases or facts coming into existence before<br />
its commencement in the sense that it<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(85 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
affects, even if for the future only, the<br />
character or consequences of transactions<br />
previously entered into or of other past<br />
conduct. By virtue of the presumption<br />
against retrospective applicability of laws<br />
dealing with substantive rights transactions<br />
are neither invalidated by reason of their<br />
failure to comply with formal requirements<br />
subsequently imposed, nor open to attack<br />
under powers of avoidance subsequently<br />
conferred. They are also not rendered valid<br />
by subsequent relaxations of the law,<br />
whether relating to form or to substance.<br />
Similarly, provisions in which a contrary<br />
intention does not appear neither impose<br />
new liabilities in respect of events taking<br />
place before their commencement, nor<br />
relieve persons from liabilities then<br />
existing, and the view that existing<br />
obligations were not intended to be<br />
affected has been taken in varying degrees<br />
even of provisions expressly prohibiting<br />
proceedings. (See: Halsbury&#8217;s Laws of<br />
England, 4th Edn. Vol. 44, paras 921, 922,<br />
925 and 926).<br />
54. Having noted the aforesaid observations, it is very<br />
clear that in the facts of the present case, the<br />
Appellant&#8217;s status as a deemed tenant was accepted<br />
under the state enactment, and therefore he could not<br />
be said to be in &#8220;unauthorised occupation&#8221;. His right<br />
granted by the state enactment cannot be destroyed by<br />
giving any retrospective application to the provisions of<br />
Public Premises Act, since there is no such express<br />
provision in the statute, nor is it warranted by any<br />
implication. In fact his premises would not come within<br />
the ambit of the Public Premises Act, until they<br />
belonged to the Respondent No. 1, i.e. until 1.1.1974.<br />
The corollary is that if the Respondent No. 1 wanted to<br />
evict the Appellant, the remedy was to resort to the<br />
procedure available under the Bombay Rent Act or its<br />
successor Maharashtra Rent Control Act, by<br />
approaching the forum thereunder, and not by resorting<br />
to the provisions of the Public Premises Act.”<br />
45. In the case of State of Punjab and Ors. vs. Bhajan Kaur<br />
and Ors.: (supra) , the Apex Court of the land, held thus:<br />

“9. A statute is presumed to be prospective unless held<br />
to be retrospective, either expressly or by necessary<br />
implication. A substantive law is presumed to be<br />
prospective. It is one of the facets of rule of law.<br />
10. Section 92-A of the 1939 Act created a right and a<br />
liability on the owner of the vehicle. It is a statutory<br />
liability. Per se it is not a tortuous liability.<br />
Where a right is created by an enactment, in absence<br />
of a clear provision in the statute, it is not to be applied<br />
retrospectively.<br />
13. No reason has been assigned as to why the 1988<br />
Act should be held to be retrospective in character. The<br />
rights and liabilities of the parties are determined when<br />
cause of action for filing the claim petition arises. As<br />
indicated hereinbefore, the liability under the Act is a<br />
statutory liability. The liability could, thus, be made<br />
retrospective only by reason of a statute or statutory<br />
rules. It was required to be so stated expressly by the<br />
Parliament. Applying the principles of interpretation of<br />
statute, the 1988 Act cannot be given retrospective<br />
effect, more particularly, when it came into force on or<br />
about 1.07.1989.<br />
17. In Garikapati v. Subbaiah Chowdhary<br />
[1957]1SCR488 , the law is stated, thus:<br />
25&#8230;The golden rule of construction is that,<br />
in the absence of anything in the<br />
enactment to show that it is to have<br />
retrospective operation, it cannot be so<br />
construed as to have the effect of altering<br />
the law applicable to a claim in litigation at<br />
the time when the Act was passed.…<br />
23. In Madishetti Bala Ramul (D) by LRs. v. The Land<br />
Acquisition Officer: (2007)9SCC650 , this Court<br />
observed:<br />
“19. In Land Acquisition Officer-cum-<br />
DSWO, A.P. v. B.V. Reddy and Sons this<br />
Court opined that Section 25 being not a<br />
procedural provision will have no<br />
retrospective effect, holding:<br />
6. Coming to the second question, it is a<br />
well- settled principle of construction that a<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(87 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
substantive provision cannot be<br />
retrospective in nature unless the provision<br />
itself indicates the same. The amended<br />
provision of Section 25 nowhere indicates<br />
that the same would have any retrospective<br />
effect. Consequently, therefore, it would<br />
apply to all acquisitions made subsequent to<br />
24-9-1984, the date on which Act 68 of<br />
1984 came into force. The Land Acquisition<br />
(Amendment) Bill of 1982 was introduced in<br />
Parliament on 30- 4-1982 and came into<br />
operation with effect from 24-9-1984&#8230;.<br />
27. For the reasons aforementioned, the decisions of<br />
Kerala and Punjab &#038; Haryana High Court do not lay<br />
down a good law. They are overruled accordingly.<br />
However, as the State has not asked for any relief<br />
against the respondents, this appeal is dismissed. No<br />
costs.<br />
46. In the case of Joseph Isharat vs. Rozy Nishikant<br />
Gaikwad:(supra), the Bombay High Court, held thus:<br />
“4. Under the Benami Act, as it stood on the date of the<br />
suit as well as on the date of filing of written statement<br />
and passing of the decree by the courts below,<br />
provided for the definition of a &#8220;benami transaction&#8221;<br />
under clause (a) of Section 2. Under that provision, any<br />
transaction in which property is transferred to one<br />
person for consideration paid or provided by another<br />
came within the definition of &#8220;benami transaction&#8221;.<br />
Section 3 of the Benami Act, in sub-section (1),<br />
provided that no person shall enter into any benami<br />
transaction. Sub-section (2) contained two exceptions<br />
to the prohibition contained in sub-section (1). The first<br />
exception, contained in clause (a) of sub-section (2),<br />
was in respect of purchase of property by any person in<br />
the name of his wife or unmarried daughter. In the<br />
case of such purchase, it was to be presumed, unless<br />
the contrary was proved, that the property was<br />
purchased for the benefit of the wife or unmarried<br />
daughter, as the case may be. Simultaneously, Section<br />
4 of the Benami Act contained a prohibition in respect<br />
of right to recover property held benami. Sub-section<br />
(1) provided that no suit, claim or action to enforce any<br />
right in respect of any property held benami against<br />
the person in whose name the property is held, or<br />
against any other person, shall lie by or on behalf of a<br />
person claiming to be the real owner of such property.<br />
Sub-section (2) made provisions likewise in respect of a<br />
defence based on a plea of benami transaction. Sub-<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(88 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
section (2) provided that no defence based on any right<br />
in respect of any property held benami, whether<br />
against the person in whose name the property is held<br />
or against any other person, shall be allowed in any<br />
suit, claim or action by or on behalf of a person<br />
claiming to be the real owner of such property. There<br />
was a twofold exception to this restriction. First was in<br />
respect of the person in whose name the property is<br />
held being a coparcener in a Hindu undivided family<br />
and the property being held for the benefit of the<br />
coparceners of the family. The second exception was in<br />
respect of the person, in whose name the property was<br />
held, being a trustee or other person standing in a<br />
fiduciary capacity and the property being held for the<br />
benefit of another person for whom he was such<br />
trustee or towards whom he stood in such capacity. The<br />
present suit was filed when these provisions were in<br />
operation. These provisions continued to apply even<br />
when the written statement was filed by the Defendant<br />
and the suit was heard and decreed by both the courts<br />
below. The legal provisions continued to apply even<br />
when the second appeal was filed before this court. It<br />
is only now during the pendency of the second appeal,<br />
when it has come up for final hearing, that there is a<br />
change in law. The Benami Act has been amended by<br />
the Parliament in 2016 with the passing of the Benami<br />
Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act, 2016. This<br />
amendment has come into effect from 01 November<br />
2016. In the Amended Act the definition of &#8220;benami<br />
transaction&#8221; has undergone a change. Under the<br />
Amended Act &#8220;benami transaction&#8221; means (under<br />
Section 2(9) of the Act) a transaction or an<br />
arrangement where a property is transferred to, or is<br />
held by, a person, and the consideration for such<br />
property has been provided, or paid by, another<br />
person; and the property is held for the immediate or<br />
future benefit, direct or indirect, of the person who has<br />
provided the consideration. There are four exceptions<br />
to this rule. The first is in respect of a karta or a<br />
member of a Hindu undivided family holding the<br />
property for the benefit of the family. The second<br />
exception is in respect of a person standing in a<br />
fiduciary capacity holding the property for the benefit of<br />
another person towards whom he stands in such<br />
capacity. The third exception is in the case of an<br />
individual who purchases the property in the name of<br />
his spouse or child, the consideration being provided or<br />
paid out of the known sources of the individual. The<br />
fourth exception is in the case of purchase of property<br />
in the name of brother or sister or lineal ascendant or<br />
descendant where the names of such brother or sister<br />
or lineal ascendant or descendant, as the case may be,<br />
and the individual appear as joint owners in any<br />
document. Sub-section (1) of Section 3 contains the<br />
very same prohibition as under the unamended Act, in<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(89 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
that it prohibits all benami transactions. Section 4<br />
likewise prohibits suits, claims or actions or defences<br />
based on the plea of benami as in the case of the<br />
unamended Act. The submission is that under this<br />
scheme of law, step-daughter not having been defined<br />
under the Benami Act, but having been defined under<br />
the Income Tax Act, 1961, by virtue of sub-section (31)<br />
of Section 2 of the amended Benami Act, the meaning<br />
of the expression will be the one assigned to it under<br />
the Income Tax Act. The definition of daughter under<br />
the Income Tax Act admits of a step-child within it. It is<br />
submitted that under the amended definition of<br />
&#8220;benami transaction&#8221;, thus, there is a clear exception in<br />
respect of a purchase made in the name of a stepdaughter<br />
by an individual provided, of course, the<br />
consideration has been provided or paid out of known<br />
sources of the individual.<br />
7. What is crucial here is, in the first place, whether the<br />
change effected by the legislature in the Benami Act is<br />
a matter of procedure or is it a matter of substantial<br />
rights between the parties. If it is merely a procedural<br />
law, then, of course, procedure applicable as on the<br />
date of hearing may be relevant. If, on the other hand,<br />
it is a matter of substantive rights, then prima facie it<br />
will only have a prospective application unless the<br />
amended law speaks in a language &#8220;which expressly or<br />
by clear intention, takes in even pending matters.&#8221;.<br />
Short of such intendment, the law shall be applied<br />
prospectively and not retrospectively.<br />
8. As held by the Supreme Court in the case of R.<br />
Rajagopal Reddy v. Padmini Chandrasekharan (1995) 2<br />
SCC 630, Section 4 of the Benami Act, or for that<br />
matter, the Benami Act as a whole, creates substantive<br />
rights in favour of benamidars and destroys substantive<br />
rights of real owners who are parties to such<br />
transaction and for whom new liabilities are created<br />
under the Act. Merely because it uses the word &#8220;it is<br />
declared&#8221;, the Act is not a piece of declaratory or<br />
curative legislation. If one has regard to the substance<br />
of the law rather than to its form, it is quite clear, as<br />
noted by the Supreme Court in R. Rajagopal Reddy,<br />
that the Benami Act affects substantive rights and<br />
cannot be regarded as having a retrospective<br />
operation. The Supreme Court in R. Rajagopal Reddy<br />
also held that since the law nullifies the defences<br />
available to the real owners in recovering the properties<br />
held benami, the law must apply irrespective of the<br />
time of the benami transaction and that the expression<br />
&#8220;shall lie&#8221; in Section 4(1) or &#8220;shall be allowed&#8221; in<br />
Section 4(2) are prospective and apply to the present<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(90 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
(future stages) as well as future suits, claims and<br />
actions only. These observations clearly hold the field<br />
even as regards the present amendment to the Benami<br />
Act. The amendments introduced by the Legislature<br />
affect substantive rights of the parties and must be<br />
applied prospectively.”<br />
47. In the case of Jeans Knit (P) Ltd. vs. Deputy Commissioner<br />
of Income Tax and Ors (supra), the Supreme Court, held thus:<br />
“2. We may make it clear that this Court has not made<br />
any observations on the merits of the cases, i.e. the<br />
contentions which are raised by the Appellant<br />
challenging the move of the IT authorities to reopen<br />
the assessment. Each case shall be examined on its<br />
own merits keeping in view the scope of judicial review<br />
while entertaining such matters, as laid down by this<br />
Court in various judgments.<br />
3. We are conscious of the fact that the High Court has<br />
referred to the judgment of this Court in CIT v. Chhabil<br />
Dass Agarwal (2013) 261 CTR (SC) 113 : (2013) 91<br />
DTR (SC) 193 : (2013) 357 ITR 357 (SC). We find that<br />
the principle laid down in the said case does not apply<br />
to these cases.<br />
4. During the pendency of these appeals, stay of<br />
reassessment was granted, which shall continue till the<br />
disposal of the writ petitions before the High Courts.<br />
The appeals are allowed in the aforesaid terms.<br />
48. In the case of Raza Textiles Ltd. vs. Income Tax Officer,<br />
Rampur:(supra), the Apex Court of the land, observed thus:<br />
3. There was material before him on this question. He<br />
had jurisdiction to decide the question either way. It<br />
cannot be said that the officer assumed jurisdiction by<br />
wrong decision on this question of residence&#8221;. The<br />
Appellate Bench appears to have been under the<br />
impression that the Income-tax Officer was the sole<br />
judge of the fact whether the firm in question was<br />
resident or non-resident. This conclusion, in our<br />
opinion, is wholly wrong. No authority, much less a<br />
quasi-judicial authority, can confer jurisdiction on itself<br />
by deciding a jurisdictional fact wrongly The question<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(91 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
whether the jurisdictional fact has been rightly decided<br />
or not is a question that is open for examination by the<br />
High Court in an application for a writ of certiorari. If<br />
the High Court comes to the conclusion, as the learned<br />
single Judge has done in this case, that the Income-tax<br />
Officer had clutched at the jurisdiction by deciding a<br />
jurisdictional fact erroneously, then the assesses was<br />
entitled for the writ of certiorari prayed for by him. It is<br />
incomprehensible to think that a quasi-judicial<br />
authority like the Income-tax Officer can erroneously<br />
decide a jurisdictional fact and thereafter proceed to<br />
impose a levy on a citizen. In our opinion the Appellate<br />
Bench is wholly wrong in opining that the Income-tax<br />
Officer can &#8220;decide either way&#8221;.<br />
49. In the case of Malayala Manorama Co. Ltd vs Assistant<br />
Commissioner, Commercial Taxes, (supra), it has been held<br />
thus:<br />
“4. The Assistant Commissioner, Commercial Tax, who<br />
had issued the notice, came to the conclusion that the<br />
concession has been extended to non-taxable goods<br />
also and formed an opinion that the concession is<br />
applicable only to `goods&#8217; and newspaper was not a<br />
`goods&#8217; within the meaning of Section 2 of the Act.<br />
While referring to another judgment of this Court<br />
in Collector of Central Excise v. Ballarpur Industries Ltd.<br />
[(1989) 4 SCC 566 : (1990) 77 Sales Tax Cases 282],<br />
the said Assistant Commissioner concluded that<br />
newspaper was not a `goods&#8217; and, therefore, the<br />
declaration was not appropriate and imposed a penalty<br />
of Rs. 14,66,256 for the year 2000-2001.<br />
5. The assessee firm did not take recourse to the<br />
statutory remedies available under the Act but<br />
questioned the very correctness and legality of the<br />
issuance of the notice as well as the order passed by<br />
the Assistant Commissioner before the High Court of<br />
Kerala at Ernakulam, by filing a writ petition<br />
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.<br />
6. This writ petition was contested by the Department<br />
which filed detailed counter affidavit. It was specifically<br />
pleaded by the Department that for availability of<br />
statutory alternative remedy as well as for other<br />
reasons and facts stated in the reply, the writ petition<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(92 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
itself was not maintainable. The Division Bench of the<br />
High Court while considering this primary objection<br />
raised by the Department before the High Court, came<br />
to the conclusion that as the facts were not in dispute<br />
and questions raised were purely legal and are to be<br />
tested in view of the judgment of this Court in the case<br />
of Printers (Mysore) Ltd. v. Assistant Commercial Tax Officer [(1994)<br />
93 Sales Tax Cases 95 : (1994) 2 SCC 434], Whirlpool<br />
Corporation v. Registrar of Trade Marks [(1998) 8<br />
SCC 1] as well as the judgment in the case of State of<br />
H.P. &#038; Ors. v. Gujarat Ambuja Cements Ltd. [(2005) 6<br />
SCC 499 : (2005) 142 Sales Tax Cases 1], the writ<br />
petition was maintainable. However, while laying<br />
emphasis that the newspaper would not fall within the<br />
expression `goods&#8217; under sub-section 3 of Section 5 of<br />
the Act, the High Court held that the notice issued was<br />
proper as Form No. 18 which gives benefit of<br />
concessional rate of tax was factually not correct. While<br />
dismissing the writ petition, however, the Bench issued<br />
a direction to the assessing authority to examine<br />
whether the imposition of penalty at double the rate is<br />
justified in the facts and circumstances of the case,<br />
within a period of two months from the date of receipt<br />
of the copy of the judgment. It is this judgment of the<br />
High Court which has been assailed in the present<br />
appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution of India.<br />
9. Having heard the learned senior counsel appearing<br />
for the parties, we are of the considered view that the<br />
order under challenge requires interference by this<br />
Court. There is no dispute to the fact that the material<br />
amendments were carried out in the provisions<br />
of Section 5(3) of the Act with effect from 01.04.2002.<br />
The existing 1st proviso to Section 5(3)(i) was deleted<br />
as well as the expression `or uses the same in the<br />
manufacture of any goods which are not liable to tax in<br />
this Act&#8217; in Section 5(3)(i) was also deleted. Despite<br />
these amendments, as it appears from the record<br />
before the Court, format of Form No. 18 has not been<br />
amended consequently. However, the fact of the matter<br />
remains that the High Court has not dwelt upon these<br />
legal issues which are the core issues involved in the<br />
present case. In our view, the discussion on the first<br />
issue would certainly have some bearing on the<br />
alternative argument raised on behalf of the appellant<br />
before us. Thus, it may not be possible for this Court to<br />
sustain the finding recorded by the High Court in that<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(93 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
regard. Of course, we are not ruling out all the<br />
possibilities of the High Court arriving at the same<br />
conclusion if it is of that view after examining the<br />
amendments as well as the submissions made on<br />
behalf of the appellant with regard to its alternative<br />
submissions. In light of this discussion, we pass the<br />
following order :<br />
(a) The impugned order dated 2nd August, 2006<br />
passed by the High Court is hereby set aside.<br />
(b) The matter is remanded to the High Court for<br />
consideration afresh in accordance with law on both the<br />
aforesaid submissions while leaving all the contentions<br />
of the assessee and the Department open for the year<br />
2000- 2001, in relation to imposition of penalty<br />
under Section 45 (A) of the Act.<br />
(c) The legality and validity or otherwise of the notice<br />
dated 16.01.2006 and 17.01.2006 shall be subject to<br />
the final decision of the High Court.”<br />
50. In the case of K.T. Plantation Pvt. Ltd. and Ors. vs. State<br />
of Karnataka, (supra), the Supreme Court observed thus:<br />
“110. Article 300A proclaims that no person can be<br />
deprived of his property save by authority of law,<br />
meaning thereby that a person cannot be deprived of<br />
his property merely by an executive fiat, without any<br />
specific legal authority or without the support of law<br />
made by a competent legislature. The expression<br />
&#8216;Property&#8217; in Article 300A confined not to land alone, it<br />
includes intangibles like copyrights and other<br />
intellectual property and embraces every possible<br />
interest recognised by law. This Court in State of W.B.<br />
and Ors. v. Vishnunarayan and Associates (P) Ltd and<br />
Anr. MANU/SC/0199/2002 : (2002) 4 SCC 134, while<br />
examining the provisions of the West Bengal Great<br />
Eastern Hotel (Acquisition of Undertaking) Act, 1980,<br />
held in the context of Article 300A that the State or<br />
executive offices cannot interfere with the right of<br />
others unless they can point out the specific provisions<br />
of law which authorises their rights. Article 300A,<br />
therefore, protects private property against executive<br />
action. But the question that looms large is as to what<br />
extent their rights will be protected when they are<br />
sought to be illegally deprived of their properties on<br />
the strength of a legislation. Further, it was also<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(94 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
argued that the twin requirements of &#8216;public purpose&#8217;<br />
and &#8216;compensation&#8217; in case of deprivation of property<br />
are inherent and essential elements or ingredients, or<br />
&#8220;inseparable concomitants&#8221; of the power of eminent<br />
domain and, therefore, of entry 42, List III, as well<br />
and, hence, would apply when the validity of a statute<br />
is in question. On the other hand, it was the<br />
contention of the State that since the Constitution<br />
consciously omitted Article 19(1)(f), Articles 31(1) and<br />
31(2), the intention of the Parliament was to do away<br />
the doctrine of eminent domain which highlights the<br />
principles of public purpose and compensation.<br />
111. Seervai in his celebrated book &#8216;Constitutional Law<br />
of India&#8217; (Edn. IV), spent a whole Chapter XIV on the<br />
44th Amendment, while dealing with Article 300A. In<br />
paragraph 15.2 (pages 1157-1158) the author opined<br />
that confiscation of property of innocent people for the<br />
benefit of private persons is a kind of confiscation<br />
unknown to our law and whatever meaning the word<br />
&#8220;acquisition&#8221; may have does not cover &#8220;confiscation&#8221;<br />
for, to confiscate means &#8220;to appropriate to the public<br />
treasury (by way of penalty)&#8221;. Consequently, the law<br />
taking private property for a public purpose without<br />
compensation would fall outside Entry 42 List III and<br />
cannot be supported by another Entry in List III.<br />
Requirements of a public purpose and the payment of<br />
compensation according to the learned author be read<br />
into Entry 42 List III. Further the learned author has<br />
also opined that the repeal of Article 19(1)(f) and 31(2)<br />
could have repercussions on other fundamental rights<br />
or other provisions which are to be regarded as part of<br />
the basic structure and also stated that notwithstanding<br />
the repeal of Article 31(2), the word &#8220;compensation&#8221; or<br />
the concept thereof is still retained in Article 30(1A)<br />
and in the second proviso to Article 31A(1) meaning<br />
thereby that payment of compensation is a condition of<br />
legislative power in Entry 42 List III.<br />
51. In the case of Mangathai Ammal (Died) through L.Rs.<br />
and Ors. vs. Rajeswari and Ors. (supra), it has been held<br />
thus:<br />
“12. It is required to be noted that the benami<br />
transaction came to be amended in the year 2016. As<br />
per Section 3 of the Benami Transaction (Prohibition)<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(95 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
Act 1988, there was a presumption that the transaction<br />
made in the name of the wife and children is for their<br />
benefit. By Benami Amendment Act, 2016, Section 3(2)<br />
of the Benami Transaction Act, 1988 the statutory<br />
presumption, which was rebuttable, has been omitted.<br />
It is the case on behalf of the Respondents that<br />
therefore in view of omission of Section 3(2) of the<br />
Benami Transaction Act, the plea of statutory<br />
transaction that the purchase made in the name of wife<br />
or children is for their benefit would not be available in<br />
the present case. Aforesaid cannot be accepted. As<br />
held by this Court in the case of Binapani Paul (Supra)<br />
the Benami Transaction (Prohibition) Act would not be<br />
applicable retrospectively. Even otherwise and as<br />
observed hereinabove, the Plaintiff has miserably failed<br />
to discharge his onus to prove that the Sale Deeds<br />
executed in favour of Defendant No. 1 were benami<br />
transactions and the same properties were purchased<br />
in the name of Defendant No. 1 by Narayanasamy<br />
Mudaliar from the amount received by him from the<br />
sale of other ancestral properties.<br />
52. In the case of R. Rajagopal Reddy (Dead) by L.Rs. and<br />
Ors. vs. Padmini Chandrasekharan (Dead) by L.Rs. (supra),<br />
the Supreme Court held thus:<br />
“A mere look at the above provisions shows that the<br />
prohibition under Section 3(1) is against persons who<br />
are to enter into benami transactions and it has laid<br />
down that no person shall enter into any benami<br />
transaction which obviously means from the date on<br />
which this prohibition comes into operation i.e. with<br />
effect from September 5, 1988. That takes care of<br />
future benami transactions. We are not concerned with<br />
Sub-section (2) but subsection (3) of Section 3 also<br />
throws light on this aspect. As seen above, it states<br />
that whoever enters into any benami transaction shall<br />
be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may<br />
extend to three years or with fine or with both.<br />
Therefore, the provision creates a new offence of<br />
entering into such benami transactions.<br />
It is made non-cognizable and bailable as laid down<br />
under Sub-section (4). It is obvious that<br />
when a statutory provision creates new liability and<br />
new offence, it would naturally have prospective<br />
operation and would cover only those offences which<br />

(96 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
take place after Section 3(1) comes into operation.<br />
In fact Saikia J. speaking for the Court in Mithilesh<br />
Kumari&#8217;s case (supra) has in terms observed at page<br />
635 of the report that Section 3 obviously cannot have<br />
retrospective operation. We respectfully concur with<br />
this part of the learned Judge&#8217;s view. The real problem<br />
centers round the effect of Section 4(1) on pending<br />
proceedings wherein claim to any property on account<br />
of it being held benami by other side is on the anvil and<br />
such proceeding had not been finally disposed of by the<br />
time Section 4(1) came into operation, namely, on 19th<br />
May, 1988. Saikia J. speaking for the Division Bench in<br />
the case of Mithilesh Kumari (supra) gave the following<br />
reasons for taking the view that though Section 3 is<br />
prospective and though Section 4(1) is also not<br />
expressly made retrospective, by the legislature, by<br />
necessary implication, it appears to be retrospective<br />
and would apply to all pending proceedings wherein<br />
right to property allegedly held benami is in dispute<br />
between parties and that Section 4(1) will apply at<br />
whatever stage the litigation might be pending in the<br />
hierarchy of the proceedings :-<br />
(1)………………….<br />
(2)………………….<br />
(3) When an Act is declaratory in nature, the<br />
presumption against retrospectivity is not applicable. A<br />
statute declaring the benami transactions to be<br />
unenforceable belongs to this type. The presumption<br />
against taking away vested right will not apply in this<br />
case in as much as under law it is the benamidar in<br />
whose name the property stands, and law only enabled<br />
the real owner to recover the property from him which<br />
right has now been ceased by the Act. In one sense<br />
there was a right to recover or resist in the real owner<br />
against the benamidar. Ubi Jus ibi remedium. Where<br />
the remedy is barred, the right is rendered<br />
unenforceable.<br />
(4) When the law nullifies the defences available to the<br />
real owners in recovering the benami property from the<br />
benamidar, the law must apply irrespective of the time<br />
of the benami transactions. The expression &#8220;shall lie&#8221;<br />
under Section 4(1) and &#8220;shall be allowed&#8221; in Section<br />
4(2) are prospective and shall apply to present (future<br />
stages) and future suits, claims or action only.<br />
(5)……………………………..<br />

(97 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
11. Before we deal with these six considerations which<br />
weighed with the Division Bench for taking the view<br />
that Section 4 will apply retrospectively in the sense<br />
that it will get telescoped into all pending proceedings,<br />
howsoever earlier they might have been filed, if they<br />
were pending at different stages in the hierarchy of the<br />
proceedings even upto this Court, when Section 4 came<br />
into operation, it would be apposite to recapitulate the<br />
salient feature of the Act. As seen earlier, the preamble<br />
of the Act itself states that it is an act to prohibit<br />
benami transactions and the right to recover property<br />
held benami, for matters connected therewith or<br />
incidental thereto. Thus it was enacted to efface the<br />
then existing rights of the real owners of properties<br />
held by others benami. Such an act was not given any<br />
retrospective effect by the legislature. Even when we<br />
come to Section 4, it is easy to visualise that Subsection<br />
(1). of Section 4 states that no suit, claim or<br />
action to enforce any right in respect of any property<br />
held benami against the person in whose name the<br />
property is held or against any other shall lie by or on<br />
behalf of a person claiming to be the real owner of such<br />
property. As per Section 4(1) no such suit shall<br />
thenceforth lie to recover the possession of the<br />
property held benami by the defendant. Plaintiffs right<br />
to that effect is sought to be taken away and any suit<br />
to enforce such a right after coming into operation of<br />
Section 4(1) that is 19th May, 1988, shall not lie. The<br />
legislature in its wisdom has nowhere provided in<br />
Section 4(1) that no such suit, claim or action pending<br />
on the date when Section 4 came into force shall not be<br />
proceeded with and shall stand abated. On the<br />
contrary, clear legislative intention is seen from the<br />
words &#8220;no such claim, suit or action shall lie&#8221;, meaning<br />
thereby no such suit, claim or action shall be permitted<br />
to be filed or entertained or admitted to the portals of<br />
any Court for seeking such a relief after coming into<br />
force of Section 4(1). In Collins English Dictionary,<br />
1979 Edition as reprinted subsequently, the word &#8216;lie&#8217;<br />
has been defined in connection with suits and<br />
proceedings. At page 848 of the Dictionary while<br />
dealing with topic No. 9 under the definition of term &#8216;lie&#8217;<br />
it is stated as under :-<br />
“For an action, claim appeal ect. to subsist; be<br />
maintainable or admissible.”<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(98 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
The word &#8216;lie&#8217; in connection with the suit, claim or<br />
action is not defined by the Act. If we go by the<br />
aforesaid dictionary meaning it would mean that such<br />
suit, claim or action to get any property declared<br />
benami will not be admitted on behalf of such plaintiff<br />
or applicant against the concerned defendant in whose<br />
name the property is held on and from the date on<br />
which this prohibition against entertaining of such suits<br />
comes into force. With respect, the view taken by that<br />
Section 4(1) would apply even to such pending suits<br />
which were already filed and entertained prior to the<br />
date when the Section came into force and which has<br />
the effect of destroying the then existing right of<br />
plaintiff in connection with the suit property cannot be<br />
sustained in the face of the clear language of Section<br />
4(1). It has to be visualised that the legislature in its<br />
wisdom has not expressly made Section 4<br />
retrospective. Then to imply by necessary implication<br />
that Section 4 would have retrospective effect and<br />
would cover pending litigations filed prior to coming<br />
into force of the Section would amount to taking a view<br />
which would run counter to the legislative scheme and<br />
intent projected by various provisions of the Act to<br />
which we have referred earlier. It is, however, true as<br />
held by the Division Bench that on the express<br />
language of Section 4(1) any right inhering in the real<br />
owner in respect of any property held benami would<br />
get effaced once Section 4(1) operated, even if such<br />
transaction had been entered into prior to the coming<br />
into operation of Section 4(1), and hence-after Section<br />
4(1) applied no suit can lie in respect to such a past<br />
benami transaction. To that extent the Section may be<br />
retroactive. To highlight this aspect we may take an<br />
illustration. If a benami transaction has taken place in<br />
1980 and suit is filed in June 1988 by the plaintiff<br />
claiming that he is the real owner of the property and<br />
defendant is merely a benamidar and the consideration<br />
has flown from him then such a suit would not lie on<br />
account of the provisions of Section 4(1). Bar against<br />
filing, entertaining and admission of such suits would<br />
have become operative by June, 1988 and to that<br />
extent Section 4(1) would take in its sweep even past<br />
benami transactions which are sought to be litigated<br />
upon after coming into force of the prohibitory<br />
provision of Section 4(1); but that is the only effect of<br />
the retroactivity of Section 4(1) and nothing more than<br />
that. From the conclusion that Section 4(1) shall apply<br />
even to past benami transactions to the aforesaid<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(99 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
extent, the next step taken by the Division Bench that<br />
therefore, the then existing rights got destroyed and<br />
even though suits by real owners were filed prior to<br />
coming into operation of Section 4(1) they would not<br />
survive, does not logically follow.<br />
“17. As regards, reason No. 3, we are of the<br />
considered view that the Act cannot be treated to<br />
be declaratory in nature.<br />
Declaratory enactment declares and clarifies the<br />
real intention of the legislature in connection<br />
with an earlier existing transaction or enactment,<br />
it does not create new rights or obligations.<br />
On the express language of Section 3, the Act<br />
cannot be said to be declaratory but in substance<br />
it is prohibitory in nature and seeks to destroy<br />
the rights of the real owner qua properties held<br />
benami and in this connection it has taken away<br />
the right of the real owner both for filing a suit or<br />
for taking such a defence in a suit by benamidar.<br />
Such an Act which prohibits benami transactions<br />
and destroys rights flowing from such<br />
transactions as existing earlier is really not a<br />
declaratory enactment. With respect, we disagree<br />
with the line of reasoning which commanded to<br />
the Division Bench. In this connection, we may<br />
refer to the following observations in &#8216;Principles<br />
of Statutory Interpretation&#8217;, 5th Edition 1992, by<br />
Shri G.P. Singh, at page 315 under the caption<br />
&#8216;Declaratory statutes&#8217; :-<br />
The presumption against retrospective operation<br />
is not applicable to declaratory statutes. As states<br />
in CRAIES and approved by the Supreme Court :<br />
&#8220;For modern purposes a declaratory Act may be<br />
defined as an Act to remove doubts existing as to<br />
the common law, or the meaning or effect of any<br />
statute. Such Acts are usually held to be<br />
retrospective. The usual reason for passing a<br />
declaratory Act is to set aside what Parliament<br />
deems to have been a judicial error whether in<br />
the statement of the common law or in the<br />
interpretation of statutes. Usually, if not<br />
invariably, such an Act contains a preamble, and<br />
also the word &#8216;declared&#8217; as well as the word<br />
enacted&#8221;. But the use of the words &#8216;it is declared&#8217;<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(100 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
is not conclusive that the Act is declaratory for<br />
these words may, at times be used to introduce<br />
new rules of law and the Act in the latter case will<br />
only be amending the law and will not necessarily<br />
be retrospective. In determining, therefore, the<br />
nature of the Act, regard must be had to the<br />
substance rather than to the form. If a new Act is<br />
to explain an earlier Act, it would be without<br />
object unless construed retrospective. An<br />
explanatory Act is generally passed to supply an<br />
obvious omission or to clear up doubts as to the<br />
meaning of the previous Act. It is well settled<br />
that if a statute is curative or merely declaratory<br />
of the previous law retrospective operation is<br />
generally intended. The language &#8216;shall be<br />
deemed always to have meant&#8217; is declaratory,<br />
and is in plain terms retrospective. In the<br />
absence of clear words indicating that the<br />
amending Act is declaratory, it would not be so<br />
construed when the pre-amended provision was<br />
clear and unambiguous. An amending Act may be<br />
purely clarificatory to clear a meaning of a<br />
provision of the principal Act which was already<br />
implicit. A clarificatory amendment of this nature<br />
will have retrospective effect and, therefore, if<br />
the principal Act was existing law when the<br />
constitution came into force the amending Act<br />
also will be part of the existing law.<br />
In Mithilesh Kumari v. Prem Bihari Khare, Section<br />
4 of the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act,<br />
1988 was, it is submitted, wrongly held to be an<br />
Act declaratory in nature for it was not passed to<br />
clear any doubt existing as to the common law or<br />
the meaning or effect of any statute. The<br />
conclusion however, that Section 4 applied also<br />
to past benami transactions may be supportable<br />
on the language used in the section.<br />
18. No exception can be taken to the aforesaid<br />
observations of learned author which in our view<br />
can certainly be pressed in service for judging<br />
whether the impugned section is declaratory in<br />
nature or not. Accordingly it must be held that<br />
Section 4 or for that matter the Act as a whole is<br />
not a piece of declaratory or curative legislation.<br />
It creates substantive rights in favour of<br />
benamidars and destroys substantive rights of<br />
real owners<br />

who are parties to such transactions and for<br />
whom new liabilities are created by the Act.”<br />
53. In the case of Garikapatti Veeraya Vs. N. Subbiah<br />
Choudhury, AIR 1957 SC 540, the Supreme Court observed thus:<br />
25. In construing the articles of the Constitution we<br />
must bear in mind certain cardinal rules of<br />
construction. It has been said in Hough v. Windus<br />
[1884] 12 Q.B.D. 224, that &#8220;statutes should be<br />
interpreted, if possible, so as to respect vested right.&#8221;<br />
The golden rule of construction is that, in the absence<br />
of anything in the enactment to show that it is to have<br />
retrospective operation, it cannot be so construed as to<br />
have the effect of altering the law applicable to a claim<br />
in litigation at the time when the Act was passed<br />
[Leeds and County Bank Ltd. v. Walker (1883) 11<br />
Q.B.D. 84; Moon v. Durden (1848) 2 Ex. 22; 76 R.R.<br />
479. The following observation of Rankin C.J. in Sadar<br />
Ali v. Dalimuddin (supra) at page 520 is also apposite<br />
and helpful : &#8220;Unless the contrary can be shown the<br />
provision which takes away the jurisdiction is itself<br />
subject to the implied saving of the litigant&#8217;s right.&#8221; In<br />
Janardan Reddy v. The State [1950]1SCR940 Kania C.J.<br />
in delivering the judgment of the Court observed that<br />
our Constitution is generally speaking prospective in its<br />
operation and is not to have retroactive operation in<br />
the absence of any express provision to that effect. The<br />
same principle was reiterated in Keshavan Madhava<br />
Menon v. The State of Bombay 1951CriLJ680 and<br />
finally in Dajisaheb Mane and Others v. Shankar Rao<br />
Vithal Rao [1955]2SCR872 to which reference will be<br />
made in greater detail hereafter.<br />
54. In the case of Keshavan Madhava Menon vs. The State<br />
of Bombay, (supra), the Supreme Court held thus:<br />
7. It will be noticed that all that this clause declares is<br />
that all existing laws, in so far as they are inconsistent<br />
with the provisions of Part III shall, to the extent of<br />
such inconsistency, be void. Every statute is prima facie<br />
prospective unless it is expressly or by necessary<br />
implications made to have retrospective operation.<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(102 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
There is no reason why this rule of interpretation<br />
should not be applied for the purpose of interpreting<br />
our Constitution. We find nothing in the language of<br />
article 13(1) which may be read as indicating an<br />
intention to give it retrospective operation. On the<br />
contrary, the language clearly points the other way. The<br />
provisions of Part III guarantee what are called<br />
fundamental rights. Indeed, the heading of Part III is<br />
&#8220;Fundamental Rights&#8221;. These rights are given, for the<br />
first time, by and under our Constitution. Before the<br />
Constitution came into force there was no such thing as<br />
fundamental right.<br />
What article 13(1) provides is that all existing laws<br />
which clash with the exercise of the fundamental rights<br />
(which are for the first time created by the<br />
Constitution) shall to that extent be void.<br />
As the fundamental rights became operative only on<br />
and from the date of the Constitution the question of<br />
the inconsistency of the existing laws with those rights<br />
must necessarily arise on and from the date those<br />
rights came into being. It must follow, therefore, that<br />
article 13(1) can have no retrospective effect but is<br />
wholly prospective in its operation. After this first point<br />
is noted, it should further be seen that article 13(1)<br />
does not in terms make the existing laws which are<br />
inconsistent with the fundamental rights void ab initio<br />
or for all purposes. On the contrary, it provides that all<br />
existing laws, in so far as they are inconsistent with the<br />
fundamental rights, shall be void to the extent of their<br />
inconsistency.<br />
They are not void for all purposes but they are void<br />
only to the extent they come into conflict with the<br />
fundamental rights. In other words, on and after the<br />
commencement of the Constitution no existing law will<br />
be permitted to stand in the way of the exercise of any<br />
of the fundamental rights. Therefore, the voidness of<br />
the existing law is limited to the future exercise of the<br />
fundamental rights.<br />
Article 13(1) cannot be read as obliterating the entire<br />
operation of the inconsistent laws, or to wipe them out<br />
altogether from the statute book, for to do so will be to<br />
give them retrospective effect which, we have said,<br />
they do not possess.<br />
Such laws exist for all past transactions and for<br />
enforcing all rights and liabilities accrued before the<br />
date of the Constitution.<br />

(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(103 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
Learned counsel for the appellant has drawn our<br />
attention to articles 249(3), 250, 357, 358 and 369<br />
where express provision has been made for saving<br />
things done under the laws which expired. It will be<br />
noticed that each of those articles was concerned with<br />
expiry of temporary statutes. It is well known that on<br />
the expiry of a temporary statute no further<br />
proceedings can be taken under it, unless the statute<br />
itself saved pending proceedings. If, therefore, an<br />
offence had been committed under a temporary statute<br />
and the proceedings were initiated but the offender had<br />
not been prosecuted and punished before the expiry of<br />
the statute, then, in the absence of any saving clause,<br />
the pending prosecution could not be proceeded with<br />
after the expiry of the statute by efflux of time. It was<br />
on this principle that express provision was made in the<br />
several articles noted above for saving things done or<br />
omitted to be done under the expiring laws referred to<br />
therein. As explained above, article 13(1) is entirely<br />
prospective in its operation and as it was not intended<br />
to have any retrospective effect there was no necessity<br />
at all for inserting in that article any such saving<br />
clause. The effect of article 13(1) is quite different from<br />
the effect of the expiry of a temporary statute or the<br />
repeal of a statute by a subsequent statute.<br />
As already explained, article 13(1) only has the effect<br />
of nullifying or rendering all inconsistent existing laws<br />
ineffectual or nugatory and devoid of any legal force or<br />
binding effect only with respect to the exercise of<br />
fundamental rights on and after the date of the<br />
commencement of the Constitution. It has no<br />
retrospective effect and if, therefore, an act was done<br />
before the commencement of the Constitution in<br />
contravention of the provisions of any law which, after<br />
the Constitution, becomes void with respect to the<br />
exercise of any of the fundamental rights, the<br />
inconsistent law is not wiped out so far as the past act<br />
is concerned for, to say that it is, will be to give the law<br />
retrospective effect.<br />
There is no fundamental right that a person shall not<br />
be prosecuted and punished for an offence committed<br />
before the Constitution came into force.<br />
So far as the past acts are concerned the law exists,<br />
notwithstanding that it does not exist with respect to<br />
the future exercise of fundamental rights.<br />
We, therefore, agree with the conclusion arrived at by<br />
the High Court on the second question, although on<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(104 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
different grounds. In view of that conclusion, we do not<br />
consider it necessary to examine the reasons of the<br />
High Court for its conclusion. In our opinion, therefore,<br />
this appeal fails, and is dismissed.<br />
19. A reference to the Constitution will show that the<br />
framers thereof have used the word &#8220;repeal&#8221; wherever<br />
necessary (see articles 252, 254, 357, 372 and 395).<br />
They have also used such words as &#8220;invalid&#8221; (see<br />
articles 245, 255 and 276), &#8220;cease to have effect&#8221; (see<br />
articles 358 and 372), &#8220;shall be inoperative&#8221;, etc. They<br />
have used the word &#8220;void&#8221; only in two articles, these<br />
being article 13(1) and article 154, and both these<br />
articles deal with cases where a certain law is<br />
repugnant to another law to which greater sanctity is<br />
attached. It further appears that where they wanted to<br />
save things done or omitted to be done under the<br />
existing law, they have used apt language for the<br />
purpose; see for example articles 249, 250, 357, 358<br />
and 369. The thoroughness and precision which the<br />
framers of the Constitution have observed in the<br />
matters to which reference has been made, disinclines<br />
me to read into article 13(1) a saving provision of the<br />
kind which we are asked to read into it.<br />
Nor can I be persuaded to hold that treating an Act as<br />
void under article 13(1) should have a milder effect<br />
upon transactions not past and closed than the repeal<br />
of an Act or its expiry in due course of time. In my<br />
opinion, the strong sense in which the word &#8220;void&#8221; is<br />
normally used and the context in which it has been<br />
used are not to be completely ignored. Evidently, the<br />
framers of the Constitution did not approve of the laws<br />
which are in conflict with the fundamental rights, and,<br />
in my judgment, it would not be giving full effect to<br />
their intention to hold that even after the Constitution<br />
has come into force, the laws which are inconsistent<br />
with the fundamental rights will continue to be treated<br />
as good and effectual laws in regard to certain matters,<br />
as if the Constitution had never been passed. How such<br />
a meaning can be read into the words used in article<br />
13(1), it is difficult for me to understand. There can be<br />
no doubt that article 13(1) will have no retrospective<br />
operation, and transactions which are past and closed,<br />
and rights which have already vested, will remain<br />
untouched. But with regard to inchoate matters which<br />

(105 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
begun, or pending at the time of enforcement of the<br />
Constitution and not yet prosecuted to a final<br />
judgment, the very serious question arises as to<br />
whether a law which has been declared by the<br />
Constitution to be completely ineffectual can yet be<br />
applied. On principle and on good authority, the answer<br />
to this question would appear to me to be that the law<br />
having ceased to be effectual can no longer be applied.<br />
In R. v. Mawgan (Inhabitants) (1888) 8 A. &#038; E. 496 a<br />
presentment as to the non-repair of a highway had<br />
been made under 13 Geo. 3, c. 78, s. 24, but before<br />
the case came on to be tried, the Act was repealed. In<br />
that case, Lord Denman C.J. said :<br />
&#8220;If the question had related merely to the presentment,<br />
that no doubt is complete. But dum loquimur, we have<br />
lost the power of giving effect to anything that takes<br />
place under that proceeding.&#8221;And Littledale J. added :<br />
&#8220;I do not say that what is already done has become<br />
bad, but that no more can be done.&#8221; In my opinion,<br />
this is precisely the way in which we should deal with<br />
the present case.<br />
55. In the case of Thakur Bhim Singh (Dead) by Lrs and<br />
Ors. vs. Thakur Kan Singh (1980) 3 SCC 72, the Supreme Court<br />
held thus:<br />
14. Under the English law, when real or personal<br />
property is purchased in the name of a stranger, a<br />
resulting trust will be presumed in favour of the person<br />
who is proved to have paid the purchase money in the<br />
character of the purchaser. It is, however, open to the<br />
transferee to rebut that presumption by showing that<br />
the intention of the person who contributed the<br />
purchase money was that the transferee should himself<br />
acquire the beneficial interest in the property. There is,<br />
however, an exception to the above rule of presumption<br />
made by the English law when the person who gets the<br />
legal title under the conveyance is either a child or the<br />
wife of the person who contributes the purchase money<br />
or his grand child, whose father is dead. The rule<br />
applicable in such cases is known as the doctrine of<br />
advancement which requires the court to presume that<br />
the purchase is for the benefit of the person in whose<br />
favour the legal title is transferred even though the<br />
purchase money may have been contributed by the<br />
father or the husband or the grandfather, as the case<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(106 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
may be, unless such presumption is rebutted by<br />
evidence showing that it was the intention of the<br />
person who paid the purchase money that the<br />
transferee should not become the real owner of the<br />
property in question. The doctrine of advancement is<br />
not in vogue in India. The counterpart of the English<br />
law of resulting trust referred to above is the Indian law<br />
of benami transactions. Two kinds of benami<br />
transactions are generally recognized in India. Where a<br />
person buys a property with his own money but in the<br />
name of another person without any intention to<br />
benefit such other person, the transaction is called<br />
benami. In that case, the transferee holds the property<br />
for the benefit of the person who has contributed the<br />
purchase money, and he is the real owner. The second<br />
case which is loosely termed as a benami transaction is<br />
a case where a person who is the owner of the property<br />
executes a conveyance in favour of another without the<br />
intention of transferring the title to the property<br />
thereunder. In this case, the transferor continues to be<br />
the real owner. The difference between the two kinds of<br />
benami transactions referred to above lies in the fact<br />
that whereas in the former case, there is an operative<br />
transfer from the transferor to the transferee though<br />
the transferee holds the property for the benefit of the<br />
person who has contributed the purchase money, in the<br />
latter case, there is no operative transfer at all and the<br />
title rests with the transferor notwithstanding the<br />
execution of the conveyance. One common feature,<br />
however, in both these cases is that the real title is<br />
divorced from the ostensible title and they are vested<br />
in different persons. The question whether a<br />
transaction is a benami transaction or not mainly<br />
depends upon the intention of the person who has<br />
contributed the purchase money in the former case and<br />
upon the intention of the person who has executed the<br />
conveyance in the latter case. The principle underlying<br />
the former case is also statutorily recognized in Section<br />
82 of the Indian Trusts Act, 1882 which provides that<br />
where property is transferred to one person for a<br />
consideration paid or provided by another person and it<br />
appears that such other person did not intend to pay or<br />
provide such consideration for the benefit of the<br />
transferee, the transferee must hold the property for<br />
the benefit of the person paying or providing the<br />
consideration. This view is in accord with the following<br />
observations made by this Court in Meenakshi Mills.<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />

Madurai v. The Commissioner of Income-Tax, Madras<br />
[1956]1SCR691 .:<br />
In this connection, it is necessary to note<br />
that the word &#8216;benami&#8217; is used to denote<br />
two classes of transactions which differ<br />
from each other in their legal character and<br />
incidents. In one sense, it signifies a<br />
transaction which is real, as for example<br />
when A sells properties to B but the sale<br />
deed mentions X as the purchaser. Here<br />
the sale itself is genuine, but the real<br />
purchaser is B, X being his benamidar. This<br />
is the class of transactions which is usually<br />
termed as benami. But the word &#8216;benami&#8217;<br />
is also occasionally used, perhaps not quite<br />
accurately, to refer to a sham transaction,<br />
as for example, when A purports to sell his<br />
property to B without intending that his<br />
title should cease or pass to B. The<br />
fundamental difference between these two<br />
classes of transactions is that whereas in<br />
the former there is an operative transfer<br />
resulting in the vesting of title in the<br />
transferee, in the latter there is none such,<br />
the transferor continuing to retain the title<br />
notwithstanding the execution of the<br />
transfer deed. It is only in the former class<br />
of cases that it would be necessary, when a<br />
dispute arises as to whether the person<br />
named in the deed is the real transferee or<br />
B, to enquire into the question as to who<br />
paid the consideration for the transfer, X or<br />
B. But in the latter class of cases, when the<br />
question is whether the transfer is genuine<br />
or sham, the point for decision would be,<br />
not who paid the consideration but whether<br />
any consideration was paid.<br />

(supra)<br />
10. Section 73 of the Act reads as under :<br />
‘Employer not to dismiss or punish employee during<br />
period of sickness, etc. &#8211;<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(108 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
(1) No employer shall dismiss, discharge, or reduce or<br />
otherwise punish an employee during the period the<br />
employee is in receipt of sickness benefit or maternity<br />
benefit, nor shall he, except as provided under the<br />
regulations, dismiss, discharge or reduce or otherwise<br />
punish an employee during the period he is in receipt of<br />
disablement benefit for temporary disablement or is<br />
under medical treatment for sickness or is absent from<br />
work as a result of illness duly certified in accordance<br />
with the regulations to arise out of the pregnancy or<br />
confinement rendering the employee unfit for work.<br />
(2) No notice of dismissal or discharge or reduction<br />
given to an employee during the period specified in<br />
sub-section (1) shall be valid or operative.&#8221;<br />
Mr. Dolia contends that since this Act has been passed<br />
for conferring certain benefits on employees in case of<br />
sickness, maternity and employment injury, it is<br />
necessary that the operative provisions of the Act<br />
should receive a liberal and beneficent construction<br />
from the court.<br />
It is a piece of social legislation intended to confer<br />
specified benefits on workmen to whom it applies, and<br />
so, it would be inappropriate to attempt to construe the<br />
relevant provisions in a technical or a narrow sense.<br />
This position cannot be disputed. But in dealing with<br />
the plea raised by Mr. Dolia that the section should be<br />
liberally construed, we cannot overlook the fact that<br />
the liberal construction must ultimately flow from the<br />
words used in the section. If the words used in the<br />
section are capable of two constructions one of which is<br />
shown patently to assist the achievement of the object<br />
of the Act, courts would be justified in preferring that<br />
construction to the other which may not be able to<br />
further the object of the Act.<br />
But, on the other hand, if the words used in the section<br />
are reasonably capable of only one construction and<br />
are clearly intractable in regard to the construction for<br />
which Mr. Dolia contends, the doctrine of liberal<br />
construction can be of no assistance.<br />
56. In the case of Sree Bank Ltd. vs. Sarkar Dutt Roy and Co.<br />
(Supra), the Supreme Court observed thus:<br />

(109 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
5. Two reasons have operated on my mind to lead me<br />
to the conclusion that the general rule should not be<br />
applied in the present case. First, it is recognised that<br />
the general rule is not invariable and that it is a sound<br />
principle in considering whether the intention was that<br />
the general rule should not be applied, to &#8220;look to the<br />
general scope and purview of the statute, and at the<br />
remedy sought to be applied, and consider what was<br />
the former state of the law and what it was that the<br />
Legislature contemplated.&#8221; : see Pardo v. Bingham<br />
(1869) L.R. 4 Ch. A. 735. Again in Craies on Statute<br />
Law, 6th ed., it is stated at p. 395, &#8220;If a statute is<br />
passed for the purpose of protecting the public against<br />
some evil or abuse, it may be allowed to operate<br />
retrospectively, although by such operation it will<br />
deprive some person or persons of a vested right.&#8221; To<br />
the same effect is the observation in Halsbury&#8217;s Laws of<br />
England, 3rd ed., vol. 36 p. 425. This seems to me to<br />
be plain commonsense. In ascertaining the intention of<br />
the legislature it is certainly relevant to enquire what<br />
the Act aimed to achieve. In Pardo v. Bingham<br />
L.R(1869)Ch. A. 735 a statute which took away the<br />
benefit of a longer period of limitation for a suit<br />
provided by an earlier Act was held to have<br />
retrospective operation as otherwise it would not have<br />
any operation for fifty years or more in the case of<br />
persons who were at the time of its passing residing<br />
beyond the seas. It was thought that such an<br />
extraordinary result could not have been intended. In<br />
R. v. Vine (1875) 10 Q.B. 195 the words &#8220;Every person<br />
convicted of felony shall for ever be disqualified from<br />
selling spirits by retail&#8230;. and if any person shall, after<br />
having been so convicted, take out or have any licence<br />
to sell spirits by retail, the same shall be void to all<br />
intents and purposes&#8221; were applied to a person who<br />
had been convicted of felony before the Act was passed<br />
though by doing so vested rights were affected. Mellor<br />
J. observed, (pp. 200-201). &#8220;It appears to me to be the<br />
general object of this statute that there should be<br />
restrains as to the persons who should be qualified to<br />
hold licences, not as a punishment, but for the public<br />
good, upon the ground of character&#8230; A man convicted<br />
before the Act passed is quite as much tainted as a<br />
man convicted after; and it appears to me not only the<br />
possible but the natural interpretation of the section<br />
that any one convicted of felony shall be ipso facto<br />
disqualified, and the licenses, if granted, void.&#8221;<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />

(110 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
8. If that is not the intention, then it is clear to me that<br />
sub-s. (3) need not have been enacted at all for clearly<br />
the first sub-section would by its own terms have<br />
applied to cases of winding up on a petition presented<br />
before the amending Act. It applies to all banking<br />
companies being wound up and, therefore, also to such<br />
companies as are being wound up on a petition<br />
presented before that Act. It could be said that even<br />
then the first sub-section would not have a<br />
retrospective operation but would only apply<br />
prospectively to a banking company being wound up on<br />
a petition presented before the Act. This may be<br />
illustrated by two cases. In R. v. St. Mary, Whitechapel<br />
(Inhabitants) (1848) 12 Q.B. 120 Lord Denman C.J.<br />
said that a statute &#8220;is not properly called a<br />
retrospective statute because a part of the requisites<br />
for its action is drawn from time antecedent to its<br />
passing.&#8221; Again in Master Ladies Tailors Organisation v.<br />
Minister of Labour and National Service (1950) 2 All.<br />
F.R. 525 it was observed, &#8220;The fact that a prospective<br />
benefit is in certain cases to be measured by or<br />
depends on antecedent facts does not necessarily&#8230;<br />
make the provision retrospective.&#8221;<br />
57. In the case of Rai Bahadur Seth Shreeram Durgaprasad<br />
vs. Director of Enforcement (supra), the Supreme Court<br />
observed thus:<br />
“8. The contention of the learned Counsel that recourse<br />
could not be had to the amended Section 23(1) read<br />
with Section 23C of the Act in respect of the<br />
contravention of Section 12(2) for failure on the part of<br />
the appellants to repatriate foreign exchange on<br />
shipments of manganese ore made prior to September<br />
20, 1957, and there could be no initiation of<br />
adjudication proceedings under the amended Section<br />
23(1) read with Section 23C or levy of penalty on the<br />
appellants must also fail for another reason. In<br />
Sukumar Pyne&#8217;s case the Court reversed the decision of<br />
the Calcutta High Court in Sukumar Pyne v. Union of<br />
India and Ors., AIR 1962 Cal 590 striking down<br />
Section 23(1)(a) as being violative of Article 14 of the<br />
Constitution. Regarding the point, namely, whether<br />
Section 23(1)(a) having been substituted by<br />
Amendment Act XXXIX of 1957 would have<br />
retrospective operation in respect of the alleged offence<br />
which took place in 1954, the High Court came to the<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(111 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
conclusion that the petitioner had a vested right to be<br />
tried by an ordinary court of the land with such rights<br />
of appeal as were open to all and although Section<br />
23(1)(a) was procedural, where a vested right was<br />
affected, prima facie, it was not a question of<br />
procedure. Therefore, the High Court came to the<br />
conclusion that the provision as to adjudication by the<br />
Director of Enforcement could not have any<br />
retrospective operation. It was held that &#8216;the<br />
impairment of a right by putting a new restriction<br />
thereupon is not a matter of procedure only&#8217;. It impairs<br />
a substantive right and an enactment that does so is<br />
not retrospective unless it says so expressly or by<br />
necessary intendment. The Court reversed the High<br />
Court decision and held that effect of these provisions<br />
was that after the amendment of 1957, adjudication or<br />
criminal proceedings could be taken up in respect of a<br />
contravention mentioned in section 23(1) while before<br />
the amendment only criminal proceedings before a<br />
Court could be instituted to punish the offender. In<br />
repelling the contention advanced by Shri N.C.<br />
Chatterjee that the new amendments did not apply to<br />
contravention which took place before the Act came<br />
into force, the Court observed:<br />
In our opinion, there is force in the<br />
contention of the learned Solicitor-General.<br />
As observed by this Court in Rao Shiv<br />
Bahadur Singh vs. The State of Vindhya<br />
Pradesh (1953) SCR 1188, a person<br />
accused of the commission of an offence<br />
has no vested right to be tried by a<br />
particular court or a particular procedure<br />
except in so far as there is any<br />
constitutional objection by way of<br />
discrimination or the violation of any other<br />
fundamental right is involved. It is well<br />
recognised that &#8220;no person has a vested<br />
right in any course of procedure&#8221; (vide<br />
Maxwell 11th Edition, p. 216), and we see<br />
no reason why this ordinary rule should not<br />
prevail in the present case. There is no<br />
principle underlying Art. 20 of the<br />
Constitution which makes a right to any<br />
course of procedure a vested right.<br />

(112 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
58. In the case of Nar Bahadur Bhandari and Ors. vs. State<br />
of Sikkim and Ors. (supra) , the Supreme Court held thus:<br />
“10.……………..The said Sub-section while on the one<br />
hand ensures that the application of Section 6 of the<br />
General Clauses Act is not prejudiced, on the other it<br />
expresses a different intention as contemplated by the<br />
said Section 6. The last part of the above Sub-section<br />
introduces a legal fiction whereby anything done or<br />
action taken under or in pursuance of the Act of 1947<br />
shall be deemed to have been done or taken under or<br />
in pursuance of corresponding provisions of the Act of<br />
1988. That is, the fiction is to the effect that the Act of<br />
1988 had come into force when such thing was done or<br />
action was taken.<br />
11. This aspect of the matter was clearly elucidated by<br />
the Constitution Bench in B. N. Kohli&#8217;s case (supra). In<br />
that case Ordinance 27/49 repealed Ordinance 12/49.<br />
The relevant provision in the repealing Ordinance was<br />
sub-sec.(3) of Section 58. That read as follows:<br />
&#8220;The repeal by this Act of the<br />
Administration of Evacuee Property<br />
Ordinance, 1949 or the Hyderabad<br />
Administration of Evacuee Property<br />
Regulation or of any corresponding law<br />
shall not affect the previous operation of<br />
that Ordinance, Regulation or<br />
corresponding law, and subject thereto,<br />
anything done or any action taken in the<br />
exercise of any power conferred by or<br />
under that Ordinance, Regulation or<br />
corresponding law, shall be deemed to<br />
have been done or taken in the exercise of<br />
the powers conferred by or under this Act<br />
as if this Act were in force on the day on<br />
which such thing was done or action was<br />
taken.&#8221;<br />
12. While construing the said Sub-section, the Court<br />
observed as follows:<br />
&#8220;&#8230;By the first part of Section 58(3) repeal of the<br />
statutes mentioned therein did not operate to vacate<br />
things done or action taken under those statutes. This<br />
provision appears to have been enacted with a view to<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(113 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
avoid the possible application of the rule of<br />
interpretation that where statute expires or is repealed,<br />
in the absence of a provision to the contrary, it is<br />
regarded as having never existed except as to matters<br />
and transactions past and closed: (see Surtees v.<br />
Ellison, 1829) 9 B &#038; C 752. This rule was altered by an<br />
omnibus provision in General Clauses Act, 1897,<br />
relating to the effect of repeal of statutes by any<br />
Central Act or Regulation. By Section 6 of the General<br />
Clauses Act, it is provided, in so far as it is material,<br />
that any Central Act or Regulation made after the<br />
commencement of the General Clauses Act or repeals<br />
any enactment, the repeal shall not affect the previous<br />
operation of any enactment so repealed or anything<br />
duly done or suffered thereunder, or affect any right,<br />
privilege, obligation or liability acquired, occurred or<br />
incurred under any enactment so repealed or affect any<br />
investigation legal proceeding or remedy in respect of<br />
any such right, privilege, obligation, liability, penalty,<br />
forfeiture or punishment as aforesaid; and any such<br />
investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be<br />
instituted, continued or enforced, any such penalty,<br />
forfeiture or punishment may be imposed, as if the<br />
Repealing Act or Regulation had not been passed. But<br />
the rule contained in Section 6 applies only if a<br />
different intention does not appear, and by enacting<br />
Section 58(3) the Parliament has expressed a different<br />
intention, for whereas the General Clauses Act keeps<br />
alive the previous operation of the enactment 13.<br />
repealed, and things done and duly suffered, the rights,<br />
privileges, obligations or liabilities acquired or incurred,<br />
and authorities the investigation, legal proceeding and<br />
remedies in respect of rights, privileges, obligations,<br />
liabilities, penalties, forfeitures and punishment and if<br />
the repealing Act or Regulation had not been passed,<br />
Section 58(3) of Act 31 of 1950 directs that things<br />
done or actions taken in exercise of power conferred by<br />
the repealed statutes shall be deemed to be done or<br />
taken under the repealing Act as if that latter Act were<br />
in force on the day on which such thing was done or<br />
action was taken. The rule so enunciated makes a clear<br />
departure from the rules enunciated in Section 6 of the<br />
General Clauses Act, 1897. By the first part of Section<br />
58(3) which is in terms negative, the previous<br />
operation of the repealed statutes survives the repeal.<br />
Thereby matters and transactions past and closed<br />
remain operative; so does the previous operation of the<br />
repealed statute. But as pointed out by this Court in<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(114 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
Indira Sohanlal&#8217;s case, [1955]2SCR1117 , the saving of<br />
the previous operation of the repealed law is not to be<br />
read, as saving the future operation of the previous<br />
law. The previous law stands repealed, and it has not<br />
for the future the partial operation as it is prescribed by<br />
Section 6 of General Clauses Act. All things done and<br />
actions taken under the repealed statute are deemed to<br />
be done or taken in exercise of powers conferred by or<br />
under the repealing Act, as if that Act were in force on<br />
the day on which that thing was done or action was<br />
taken. It was clearly the intention of the parliament<br />
that matters and transactions past and closed were not<br />
to be deemed vacated by the repeal of the statute<br />
under which they were done. The previous operation of<br />
the statute repealed was also affirmed expressly but<br />
things done or actions taken Under the repealed statute<br />
are to be deemed by fiction to have been done or taken<br />
under the repealing Act.&#8221;<br />
59. In the case of State of Punjab vs. Mohar Singh: (supra) ,<br />
the Supreme Court observed thus:<br />
“8………………………. These observations could not<br />
undoubtedly rank higher than mere obiter dictum for<br />
they were not at all necessary for purposes of the case,<br />
though undoubtedly they are entitled to great respect.<br />
In agreement with this dictum of Sulaiman C.J. the<br />
High Court of Punjab, in its judgment in the present<br />
case, has observed that where there is a simple repeal<br />
and the Legislature has either not given its thought to<br />
the matter of prosecuting old offenders, or a provision<br />
dealing with that question has been inadvertently<br />
omitted, section 6 of the General Clauses Act will<br />
undoubtedly be attracted. But no such inadvertence<br />
can be presumed where there has been a fresh<br />
legislation on the subject and if the new Act does not<br />
deal with the matter, it may be presumed that the<br />
Legislature did not deem it fit to keep alive the liability<br />
incurred under the old Act. In our opinion the approach<br />
of the High Court to the question is not quite correct.<br />
Whenever there is a repeal of an enactment, the<br />
consequences laid down in section 6 of the General<br />
Clauses Act will follow unless, as the section itself says,<br />
a different intention appears. In the case of a simple<br />
repeal there is scarcely any room for expression of a<br />
contrary opinion. But when the repeal is followed by<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(115 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
fresh legislation on the same subject we would<br />
undoubtedly have to look to the provisions of the new<br />
Act, but only for the purpose of determining whether<br />
they indicate a different intention.<br />
The line of enquiry would be, not whether the new Act<br />
expressly keeps alive old rights and liabilities but<br />
whether it manifests an intention to destroy them.<br />
We cannot therefore subscribe to the broad proposition<br />
that section 6 of the General Clauses Act is ruled out<br />
when there is repeal of an enactment followed by a<br />
fresh legislation. Section 6 would be applicable in such<br />
cases also unless the new legislation manifests an<br />
intention incompatible with or contrary to the<br />
provisions of the section.<br />
Such incompatibility would have to be ascertained from<br />
a consideration of all the relevant provisions of the new<br />
law and the mere absence of a saving clause is by itself<br />
not material. It is in the light of these principles that we<br />
now proceed to examine the facts of the present case.<br />
60. In the case of Zile Singh vs. State of Haryana and Ors.:<br />
(supra), the Supreme Court held thus:<br />
“13. It is a cardinal principle of construction that every<br />
statute is prima facie prospective unless it is expressly<br />
or by necessary implication made to have a<br />
retrospective operation. But the rule in general is<br />
applicable where the object of the statute is to affect<br />
vested rights or to impose new burdens or to impair<br />
existing obligations. Unless there are words in the<br />
statute sufficient to show the intention of the<br />
Legislature to affect existing rights, it is deemed to be<br />
prospective only. ‘nova Constitution futuris formam<br />
imponere debet non praeteritis&#8217; &#8211; a new law ought to<br />
regulate what is to follow, not the past. (See :<br />
Principles of Statutory Interpretation by Justice G.P.<br />
Singh, Ninth Edition, 2004 at p.438). It is not<br />
necessary that an express provision be made to make a<br />
statute retrospective and the presumption against<br />
retrospectivity may be rebutted by necessary<br />
implication especially in a case where the new law is<br />
made to cure an acknowledged evil for the benefit of<br />
the community as a whole.<br />
(ibid, p.440)<br />
14. The presumption against retrospective operation is<br />
not applicable to declaratory statutes&#8230;&#8230;.<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(116 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
In determining, therefore, the nature of the Act, regard<br />
must be had to the substance rather than to the form.<br />
If a new Act is &#8220;to explain&#8217; an earlier Act, it would be<br />
without object unless construed retrospective. An<br />
explanatory Act is generally passed to supply an<br />
obvious omission or to clear up doubts as to the<br />
meaning of the previous Act. It is well settled that if a<br />
statute is curative or merely declaratory of the previous<br />
law retrospective operation is generally intended.<br />
&#8230;&#8230;..<br />
An amending Act may be purely declaratory to clear a<br />
meaning of a provision of the principal Act which was<br />
already implicit. A clarificatory amendment of this<br />
nature will have retrospective effect.<br />
(ibid, pp.468-469).<br />
15. Though retrospectivity is not to be presumed and<br />
rather there is presumption against retrospectivity,<br />
according to Craies (Statute Law, Seventh Edition), it is<br />
open for the legislature to enact laws having<br />
retrospective operation. This can be achieved by<br />
express enactment or by necessary implication from<br />
the language employed. If it is a necessary implication<br />
from the language employed that the legislature<br />
intended a particular section to have a retrospective<br />
operation, the Courts will give it such an operation. In<br />
the absence of a retrospective operation having been<br />
expressly given, the Courts may be called upon to<br />
construe the provisions and answer the question<br />
whether the legislature had sufficiently expressed that<br />
intention giving the Statute retrospectivity.<br />
Four factors are suggested as relevant: (i) general<br />
scope and purview of , the statute; (ii) the remedy<br />
sought to be applied; (iii) the former state of the law;<br />
and (iv) what it was the legislature contemplated<br />
(p.388). The rule against retrospectivity does not<br />
extend to protect from the effect of a repeal, a privilege<br />
which did not amount to accrued right (p.392).<br />
16. Where a Statute is passed for the purpose of<br />
supplying an obvious omission in a former statute or to<br />
&#8216;explain&#8217; a former statute, the subsequent statute has<br />
relation back to the time when the prior Act was<br />
passed. The rule against retrospectivity is inapplicable<br />
to such legislations as are explanatory and declaratory<br />
in nature. The classic illustration is the case of Att. Gen.<br />
v. Pougett [1816] 2 Pri 381. By a Customs Act of 1873<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(117 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
53 Geo. 3 a duty was imposed upon hides of 9s. 4d.,<br />
but the Act omitted to state that it was to be 9s. 4d.<br />
per cwt., and to remedy this omission another Customs<br />
Act (53 Geo. 3, c. 105) was passed later in the same<br />
year. Between the passing of these two Acts some<br />
hides were exported, and it was contended that they<br />
were not liable to pay the duty of 9s. 4d. per cwt., but<br />
Thomson C.B., in giving judgment for the Attorney-<br />
General, said:<br />
&#8220;The duty in this instance was in fact<br />
imposed by the first Act, but the gross<br />
mistake of the omission of the weight for<br />
which the sum expressed was to have been<br />
payable occasioned the amendment made<br />
by the subsequent Act, but that had<br />
reference to the former statute as soon as<br />
it passed, and they must be taken together<br />
as if they were one and the same Act.&#8221;<br />
(p.395).<br />
17. Maxwell states in his work on Interpretation of<br />
Statutes, (Twelfth Edition) that the rule against<br />
retrospective operation is a presumption only, and as<br />
such it &#8220;may be overcome, not only by express words<br />
in the Act but also by circumstances sufficiently strong<br />
to displace it.&#8221; (p.225). If the dominant intention of the<br />
legislature can be clearly and doubtlessly spelt out, the<br />
inhibition contained in the rule against perpetuity<br />
becomes of doubtful applicability as the &#8220;inhibition of<br />
the rule&#8221; is a matter of degree which would &#8220;vary<br />
secundum materiam&#8221; (p.226). Sometimes, where the<br />
sense of the statute demands it or where there has<br />
been an obvious mistake in drafting, a court will be<br />
prepared to substitute another word or phrase for that<br />
which actually appears in the text of the Act (p.231).<br />
18. In a recent decision of this Court in National<br />
Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India<br />
Ltd. And Anr. v. Union of India and Ors.,<br />
(2003)181CTR(SC)1 , it has been held<br />
that there is no fixed formula for the<br />
expression of legislative intent to give<br />
retrospectivity to an enactment. Every<br />
legislation whether prospective or<br />
retrospective has to be subjected to the<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(118 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
question of legislative competence. The<br />
retrospectivity is liable to be decided on a<br />
few touchstones such as : (i) the words<br />
used must expressly provide or clearly<br />
imply retrospective operation; (ii) the<br />
retrospectivity must be reasonable and not<br />
excessive or harsh, otherwise it runs the<br />
risk of being struck down as<br />
unconstitutional; (iii) where the legislation<br />
is introduced to overcome a judicial<br />
decision, the power cannot be used to<br />
subvert the decision without removing the<br />
statutory basis of the decision. There is no<br />
fixed formula for the expression of<br />
legislative intent to give retrospectivity to<br />
an enactment. A validating clause coupled<br />
with a substantive statutory change is only<br />
one of the methods to leave actions<br />
unsustainable under the unamended<br />
statute, undisturbed. Consequently, the<br />
absence of a validating clause would not by<br />
itself affect the retrospective operation of<br />
the statutory provision, if such<br />
retrospectivity is otherwise apparent.<br />
19. The Constitution Bench in Shyam Sunder and Ors.<br />
v. Ram Kumar and Anr., AIR2001SC2472 , has held &#8212; &#8221;<br />
Ordinarily when an enactment declares the<br />
previous law, it requires to be given<br />
retroactive effect. The function of a<br />
declaratory statute is to supply an omission<br />
or explain previous statute and when such<br />
an Act is passed, it comes into effect when<br />
the previous enactment was passed. The<br />
legislative power to enact law includes the<br />
power to declare what was the previous<br />
law and when such a declaratory Act is<br />
passed invariably it has been held to be<br />
retrospective. Mere absence of use of word<br />
&#8216;declaration&#8217; in an Act explaining what was<br />
the law before may not appear to be a<br />
declaratory Act but if the Court finds an Act<br />
as declaratory or explanatory it has to be<br />
construed as retrospective.<br />
&#8221; (p. 2487).<br />

20. In The Bengal Immunity Company Ltd. v. The State<br />
of Bihar and Ors.,[1955]2SCR603 , Heydon&#8217;s case 3 C.<br />
R.7a; 76 E.R.637 was cited with approval. Their<br />
Lordships have said &#8212;<br />
&#8220;It is a sound rule of construction of a<br />
statute firmly established in England as far<br />
back as 1584 when Heydon&#8217;s case was<br />
decided that &#8211;&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;for the sure and true<br />
interpretation of all Statutes in general (be<br />
they penal or beneficial, restrictive or<br />
enlarging of the common law) four things<br />
are to be discerned and considered:-<br />
1st. What was the common law before the<br />
making of the Act.<br />
2nd. What was the mischief and defect for<br />
which the common law did not provide.,<br />
3rd. What remedy the Parliament hath<br />
resolved and appointed to cure the disease<br />
of the Commonwealth., and<br />
4th. The true reason of the remedy; and<br />
then the office of all the judges is always to<br />
make such construction as shall suppress<br />
the mischief, and advance the remedy, and<br />
to suppress subtle inventions and evasions<br />
for continuance of the mischief, and pro<br />
private commodo, and to add force and life<br />
to the cure and remedy, according to the<br />
true intent of the makers of the Act, pro<br />
bono publico&#8221;.&#8221;<br />
22. The State Legislature of Haryana intended to<br />
impose a disqualification with effect from 5.4.1994 and<br />
that was done. Any person having more than two living<br />
children was disqualified on and from that day for being<br />
a member of municipality. However, while enacting a<br />
proviso by way of an exception carving out a factsituation<br />
from the operation of the newly introduced<br />
disqualification the draftsman&#8217;s folly caused the<br />
creation of trouble. A simplistic reading of the text of<br />
the proviso spelled out a consequence which the<br />
Legislature had never intended and could not have<br />
intended. It is true that the Second Amendment does<br />
not expressly give the amendment a retrospective<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(120 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
operation. The absence of a provision expressly giving<br />
a retrospective operation to the legislation is not<br />
determinative of its prospectivity or retrospectivity.<br />
Intrinsic evidence may be available to show that the<br />
amendment was necessarily intended to have the<br />
retrospective effect and if the Court can unhesitatingly<br />
conclude in favour of retrospectivity, the Court would<br />
not hesitate in giving the Act that operation unless<br />
prevented from doing so by any mandate contained in<br />
law or an established principle of interpretation of<br />
statutes.<br />
23. The text of Section 2 of the Second Amendment Act<br />
provides for the word &#8220;upto&#8221; being substituted for the<br />
word &#8220;after&#8221;. What is the meaning and effect of the<br />
expression employed therein &#8211; &#8220;shall be substituted&#8221;.<br />
24. The substitution of one text for the other preexisting<br />
text is one of the known and well-recognised<br />
practices employed in legislative drafting. &#8216;Substitution&#8217;<br />
has to be distinguished from &#8216;supersession&#8217; or a mere<br />
repeal of an existing provision.<br />
25. Substitution of a provision results in repeal of the<br />
earlier provision and its replacement by the new<br />
provision (See Principles of Statutory Interpretation,<br />
ibid, p.565). If any authority is needed in support of<br />
the proposition, it is to be found in West U.P. Sugar<br />
Mills Assn. and Ors. v. State of U.P. and Ors. &#8211; :<br />
[2002]1SCR897 , State of Rajasthan v. Mangilal<br />
Pindwal &#8211; : (1997)IILLJ756SC , Koteswar Vittal Kamath<br />
v. K. Rangappa Baliga and Co. &#8211; [1969]3SCR40 and<br />
A.L.V.R.S.T. Veerappa Chettiar v. S. Michael and Ors. &#8211;<br />
AIR1963SC933 . In West U.P. Sugar Mills Association<br />
and Ors.&#8217;s case (supra) a three-Judges Bench of this<br />
Court held that the State Government by substituting<br />
the new rule in place of the old one never intended to<br />
keep alive the old rule. Having regard to the totality of<br />
the circumstances centering around the issue the Court<br />
held that the substitution had the effect of just deleting<br />
the old rule and making the new rule operative. In<br />
Mangilal Pindwal&#8217;s case (supra) this Court upheld the<br />
legislative practice of an amendment by substitution<br />
being incorporated in the text of a statute which had<br />
ceased to exist and held that the substitution would<br />
have the effect of amending the operation of law during<br />
the period in which it was in force. In Koteswar&#8217;s case<br />
(supra) a three-Judges Bench of this Court emphasized<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(121 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
the distinction between &#8216;supersession&#8217; of a rule arid<br />
&#8216;substitution&#8217; of a rule and held that the process of<br />
substitution consists of two steps : first, the old rule is<br />
made to cease to exist and, next, the new rule is<br />
brought into existence in its place.<br />
61. In the case of Yogendra Kumar Jaiswal and Ors. vs.<br />
State of Bihar and Ors. : (supra), the Supreme Court observed<br />
thus:<br />
“8. Section 14 provides for issuance of show cause<br />
notice by the Authorised Officer to the person<br />
concerned to explain his source of income and other<br />
assets and why such money or property or both should<br />
not be declared to have been acquired by means of the<br />
offence and be confiscated to the State Government.<br />
Sub-section (2) provides that where a notice Under<br />
Sub-section (1) to any person specifies any money or<br />
property or both has been held on behalf of such<br />
person by any other person, a copy of the notice shall<br />
also be served upon such other person. Sub-section (3)<br />
lays down that the evidence, information or particulars<br />
brought on record before the authorised officer shall<br />
not be used against the accused in the trial before the<br />
special court. Section 15 deals with the confiscation of<br />
property in certain cases. It provides a detailed<br />
procedure and obliges the authorised officer to follow<br />
the principles of natural justice. It prescribes a time<br />
limit for disposal of the proceeding and gives immense<br />
stress on identification of property or money or both<br />
which have been acquired by means of the offence and<br />
further it makes the confiscation subject to the order<br />
passed in appeal Under Section 17 of the Orissa Act. It<br />
may be noted here that the proviso to Section 15(3)<br />
stipulates that the market price of the property<br />
confiscated, if deposited with the Authorised Officer, the<br />
property shall not be confiscated. Section 16 lays down<br />
that after the issue of notice Under Section 14, any<br />
money or property or both referred to in the said notice<br />
are transferred by any mode whatsoever, such transfer<br />
shall for the purposes of the proceedings under the<br />
Orissa Act, be void and if such money or property or<br />
both are subsequently confiscated to the State<br />
Government Under Section 15, then the transfer of<br />
such money or property or both shall be deemed to be<br />
null and void. Section 17(1) enables the aggrieved<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(122 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
person by the order passed by an authorised officer to<br />
prefer an appeal within thirty days from the date on<br />
which the order appealed against was passed. Subsection<br />
(2) provides that upon appeal being preferred<br />
under the said provision, the High Court may, after<br />
giving such parties, as it thinks proper, an opportunity<br />
of being heard, pass such order as it thinks fit; Subsection<br />
(3) requires the High Court to dispose of the<br />
appeal within three months from the date it is preferred<br />
and stay order, if any, passed in appeal shall not remain<br />
in force beyond the period prescribed for disposal of<br />
appeal. Sub-section (1) of Section 18 of the Orissa Act<br />
empowers the State Government to take possession. It<br />
stipulates that where any money or property has been<br />
confiscated to the State Government under the Act, the<br />
concerned authorised officer shall order the person<br />
affected as well as any other person who may be in<br />
possession of the money or property or both, to<br />
surrender or deliver possession thereof to the<br />
concerned authorised officer or to any person duly<br />
authorised by in this behalf, within thirty days of the<br />
service of the order. The proviso to the said Sub-section<br />
stipulates that the authorised officer, on an application<br />
being made in that behalf and being satisfied that the<br />
person affected is residing in the property in question,<br />
may instead of dispossessing him immediately from the<br />
same, permit such person to occupy it for a limited<br />
period to be specified on payment of market rent to the<br />
State Government and thereafter, such person shall<br />
deliver the vacant possession of the property. Subsection<br />
(2) provides that if any person refuses or fails<br />
to comply with an order made Under Sub-section (1),<br />
the authorised officer may take possession of the<br />
property and may, for that purpose, use such force as<br />
may be necessary. Sub-section (3) confers powers on<br />
the authorised officer to requisition service of any<br />
police officer to assist and mandates the concerned<br />
police officer to comply with such requisition.<br />
Section 15. Confiscation of property in certain cases &#8211;<br />

(2)………………………………………….<br />
(3) Where the authorised officer records a finding<br />
under this section to the effect that any money or<br />
property or both have been acquired by means of the<br />
offence, he shall declare that such money or property<br />
or both shall, subject to the provisions of this Act,<br />

stand confiscated to the State Government free from<br />
all encumbrances.<br />
Provided that if the market price of the property<br />
confiscated is deposited with the authorised officer, the<br />
property shall not be confiscated.<br />

(5)……………………………………<br />
(6)…………………………………&#8230;<br />
147. The next facet of the said submission pertains to<br />
retrospective applicability. The submission has been put<br />
forth on the ground that by transfer of cases to the<br />
Special Courts under the Orissa Act in respect of the<br />
accused persons who are arrayed as accused under the<br />
1988 Act, have been compelled to face harsher<br />
punishment which is constitutionally not permissible. It<br />
is contended that there was no interim confiscation<br />
under the 1988 Act but under the Orissa Act they have<br />
to face confiscation. We have already opined that<br />
confiscation is not a punishment and, therefore, Article<br />
20(1) is not attracted. Thus, the real grievance pertains<br />
to going through the process of confiscation and<br />
suffering the same after the ultimate adjudication of<br />
the said proceeding which is subject to appeal.…..…….<br />
151. We are absolutely conscious that the said<br />
judgment was delivered in a different context. What is<br />
prohibited Under Article 20(1) is imposition of greater<br />
punishment that might have been imposed and<br />
prohibition of a conviction of any person for violation of<br />
law at the time of commission of the act. We repeat at<br />
the cost of repetition that confiscation being not a<br />
punishment does not come in either of the categories.<br />
Thus viewed, the property of an accused facing trial<br />
under the 1988 Act could be attached and there can be<br />
administration by third party of the said property and<br />
eventual forfeiture after conviction. The term<br />
&#8220;attachment&#8221; has been understood by this Court in<br />
Kerala State Financial Enterprises Ltd. v. Official<br />
Liquidator, High Court of Kerala (2006) 10 SCC 709 in<br />
the following manner:<br />
11. The word &#8220;attachment&#8221; would only<br />
mean &#8220;taking into the custody of the law<br />
the person or property of one already<br />
before the court, or of one whom it is<br />
sought to bring before it&#8221;. It is used for<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(124 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
two purposes: (i) to compel the<br />
appearance of a Defendant; and (ii) to<br />
seize and hold his property for the<br />
payment of the debt. It may also mean<br />
prohibition of transfer, conversion,<br />
disposition or movement of property by an<br />
order issued by the court.<br />
152. The legislature has thought it proper to change<br />
the nature and character of the interim measure. The<br />
property obtained by ill-gotten gains, ii prima facie<br />
found to be such by the authorised officer, is to be<br />
confiscated. An accused has no vested right as regards<br />
the interim measure. He is not protected by any<br />
constitutional right to advance the plea that he cannot<br />
be made liable to face confiscation proceedings of the<br />
property which has been accumulated, by illegal<br />
means. That being the litmus test, the filament of<br />
reasoning has to rest in favour of confiscation and not<br />
against it. Therefore, we are of the considered view<br />
that the provision does not violate any constitutional<br />
assurance.<br />
62. In the case of Titaghur Paper Mills Co. Ltd. and Ors. vs.<br />
State of Orissa and Ors.: (supra), Supreme Court, observed<br />
thus:<br />
“6. We are constrained to dismiss these petitions on the<br />
short ground that the petitioners have an equally<br />
efficacious alternative remedy by way of an appeal to<br />
the prescribed authority under Sub-section (1) of<br />
Section 23 of the Act, then a second appeal to the<br />
Tribunal under Sub-section (3)(a) thereof, and<br />
thereafter in the event the petitioners get no relief, to<br />
have the case stated to the High Court under Section<br />
23 of the Act. In Raleigh Investment Co. Limited v.<br />
Governor General in Council, 74 I.A. 50 Lord Uthwart,<br />
J. in delivering the judgment of the Board observed<br />
that in the provenance of tax where the Act provided<br />
for a complete machinery which enabled an assessee to<br />
effectively to raise in the courts the question of the<br />
validity of an assessment denied an alternative<br />
jurisdiction to the High Court to interfere. It is true that<br />
the decision of the Privy Council in Raleigh Investment<br />
Company&#8217;s case, supra, was in relation to a suit<br />
brought for a declaration that an assessment made by<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(125 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
the Income Tax Officer was a nullity, and it was held by<br />
the Privy Council that an assessment made under the<br />
machinery provided by the Act, even if based on a<br />
provision subsequently held to be ultra vires, was not a<br />
nullity like an order of a court lacking jurisdiction and<br />
that Section 67 of the Income Tax Act, 1922 operated<br />
as a bar to the maintainability of such a suit. In dealing<br />
with the question whether Section 67 operated as a bar<br />
to a suit to set aside or modify an assessment made<br />
under a provision of the Act which is ultra vires, the<br />
Privy Council observed:<br />
In construing the section it is pertinent, in their<br />
Lordships opinion to ascertain whether the Act contains<br />
machinery which enables an assessee effectively to<br />
raise in the courts the question whether a particular<br />
provision of the Income Tax Act bearing on the<br />
assessment made is or is not ultra vires. The presence<br />
of such machinery, though by no means conclusive,<br />
marches with a construction of the section which denies<br />
an alternative jurisdiction to inquire into the same<br />
subject-matter.<br />
7. We are not oblivious of the fact that this Court in<br />
K.S. Venkataraman and Co. v. State of Madras,<br />
[1966]60ITR112(SC) , in a five-Judge Bench by a<br />
majority of 3 : 2 has dissented with the view expressed<br />
by the Privy Council in Raleigh Investment Company&#8217;s<br />
case, supra, and held that an assessment made on the<br />
basis of a provision which is ultra vires is not an<br />
assessment made under the Act. It was observed that<br />
the entire reasoning of the Judicial Committee was<br />
based upon the assumption that the question of ultra<br />
vires can be canvassed and finally decided through the<br />
machinery provided under the Income Tax Act. The<br />
majority observed that the hierarchy of authorities set<br />
up under the Act being creatures of statute were not<br />
concerned as to whether the provisions of the Act were<br />
intra vires or not. If an assessee raises such a question,<br />
according to the decision of the majority in<br />
Venkataraman&#8217;s case, supra, the Appellate Tribunal can<br />
only reject it on the ground that it has no jurisdiction to<br />
entertain such objection or render any decision on it.<br />
As no such question can be raised or can even arise out<br />
of the order of the Appellate Tribunal, the High Court<br />
cannot possibly give any decision on the question of<br />
ultra vires because its jurisdiction under Section 66 is a<br />
special advisory jurisdiction and its scope is strictly<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(126 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
limited. It can only decide questions of law that arise<br />
out of the order of the Appellate Tribunal and that are<br />
referred to it. Further, an appeal to this Court under<br />
Section 66A(2) does not enlarge the scope of the<br />
jurisdiction of this Court as this Court can only do what<br />
the High Court can under Section 66. It would therefore<br />
appear that the majority decision in Venkataraman&#8217;s<br />
case, supra, rests on the principle that (i) An ultra vires<br />
provision cannot be regarded as a part of the Act at all,<br />
and an assessment under such a provision is not &#8220;made<br />
under the Act&#8221; but is wholly without the jurisdiction and<br />
is not directed by Section 67 of the Act. And (ii) The<br />
question whether a provision is ultra vires or not<br />
cannot be decided by any of the authorities created by<br />
the Act and therefore cannot be the subject matter of a<br />
reference to the High Court or a subsequent appeal to<br />
this Court.<br />
8. No such question arises in a case like the present<br />
where the impugned orders of assessment are not<br />
challenged on the ground that they are based on a<br />
provision which is ultra vires. We are dealing with a<br />
case in which the entrustment of power to assess is not<br />
in dispute, and the authority within the limits of his<br />
power is a Tribunal of exclusive jurisdiction. The<br />
challenge is only to the regularity of the proceeding<br />
before the learned Sales Tax Officer as also his<br />
authority to treat the gross turnover returned by the<br />
petitioners to be the taxable turnover. Investment of<br />
authority to tax involves authority to tax transactions<br />
which in exercise of his authority the Taxing Officer<br />
regards as taxable, and not merely authority to tax<br />
only those transactions which are, on a true view of the<br />
facts and the law, taxable.<br />
63. In the case of Thansingh Nathmal and Ors. vs. A.<br />
Mazid : (supra), the Supreme Court held thus:<br />
7. Against the order of the Commissioner an order for<br />
reference could have been claimed if the appellants<br />
satisfied the Commissioner or the High Court that a<br />
question of law arose out of the order. But the<br />
procedure provided by the Act to invoke the jurisdiction<br />
of the High Court was bypassed. The appellants moved<br />
the High Court challenging the competence of the<br />
Provincial Legislature to extend the concept of sale, and<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(127 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
invoked the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court<br />
under Art. 226 and sought to reopen the decision of the<br />
taxing authorities on questions of fact.<br />
The jurisdiction of the High Court under Art. 226 of the<br />
Constitution is couched in wide terms and the exercise<br />
thereof is not subject to any restrictions except the<br />
territorial restrictions which are expressly provided in<br />
the Article. But the exercise of the jurisdiction is<br />
discretionary; it is not exercised merely because it is<br />
lawful to do so. The very amplitude of the jurisdiction<br />
demands that it will ordinarily be exercised subject to<br />
certain self-imposed limitations. Resort so that<br />
jurisdiction is not intended as an alternative remedy for<br />
relief which may be obtained in a suit or other mode<br />
prescribed by statute. Ordinarily the Court will not<br />
entertain a petition for a writ under Art. 226, where the<br />
petitioner has an alternative remedy which, without<br />
being unduly onerous, provides an equally efficacious<br />
remedy. Again the High Court does not generally enter<br />
upon a determination of questions which demand an<br />
elaborate examination of evidence to establish the right<br />
to enforce which the writ is claimed.<br />
The High Court does not therefore act as a court of<br />
appeal against the decision of a court or tribunal, to<br />
correct errors of fact, and does not by assuming<br />
jurisdiction under Art. 226 trench upon an alternative<br />
remedy provided by statute for obtaining relief. Where<br />
it is open to the aggrieved petitioner to move another<br />
tribunal, or even itself in another jurisdiction for<br />
obtaining redress in the manner provided by a statute,<br />
the High Court normally will not permit, by entertaining<br />
a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution, the<br />
machinery created under the stature to be by-passed,<br />
and will leave the party applying to it to seek resort to<br />
the machinery so set up.<br />
64. In the case of State of H.P. and Ors. vs. Gujarat Ambuja<br />
Cement Ltd. and Ors.: (supra), the Supreme Court observed<br />
thus:<br />
“17. We shall first deal with the plea regarding<br />
alternative remedy as raised by the appellant-State.<br />
Except for a period when Article 226 was amended by<br />
the Constitution (42 Amendment) Act, 1976, the power<br />
relating to alternative remedy has been considered to<br />
be a rule of self imposed limitation. It is essentially a<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(128 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
rule of policy, convenience and discretion and never a<br />
rule of law. Despite the existence of an alternative<br />
remedy it is within the jurisdiction of discretion of the<br />
High Court to grant relief under Article 226 of the<br />
Constitution. At the same time, it cannot be lost sight<br />
of that though the matter relating to an alternative<br />
remedy has nothing to do with the jurisdiction of the<br />
case, normally the High Court should not interfere if<br />
there is an adequate efficacio4us alternative remedy. If<br />
somebody approaches the High Court without availing<br />
the alternative remedy provided the High Court should<br />
ensure that he has made out a strong case or that<br />
there exist good grounds to invoke the extra-ordinary<br />
jurisdiction.<br />
18. Constitution Benches of this Court in K.S. Rashid<br />
and Sons v. Income Tax Investigation Commission and<br />
Ors. [1954]25ITR167(SC) ; Sangram Singh v. Election<br />
Tribunal, Kotah and Ors. [1955]2SCR1 ; Union of India<br />
v. T.R. Varma (1958)IILLJ259SC ; State of U.P. and<br />
Ors. v. Mohammad Nooh AIR 1958 SC 86; and K.S.<br />
Venkataraman and Co. (P) Ltd. v. State of Madras<br />
[1966]60ITR112(SC) , held that Article 226 of the<br />
Constitution confers on all the High Courts a very wide<br />
power in the matter of issuing writs. However, the<br />
remedy of writ is an absolutely discretionary remedy<br />
and the High Court has always the discretion to refuse<br />
to grant any writ if it is satisfied that the aggrieved<br />
party can have an adequate or suitable relief<br />
elsewhere. The Court, in extraordinary circumstances,<br />
may exercise the power if it comes to the conclusion<br />
that there has been a breach of principles of natural<br />
justice or procedure required for decision has not been<br />
adopted.<br />
19. Another Constitution Bench of this Court in State of<br />
Madhya Pradesh and Anr. v. Bhailal Bhai etc. ,<br />
[1964]6SCR261 , held, that the remedy provided in a<br />
writ jurisdiction is not intended to supersede<br />
completely the modes of obtaining relief by an action in<br />
a civil court or to deny defence legitimately open in<br />
such actions. The power to give relief under Article 226<br />
of the Constitution is a discretionary power. Similar<br />
view has been re-iterated in N.T. Veluswami Thevar v.<br />
G. Raja Nainar and Ors. AIR1959SC422 ; Municipal<br />
Council, Khurai and Anr. v. Kamal Kumar and Anr.<br />

20. In Harbans Lal Sahnia v. Indian Oil Corporation<br />
Ltd : AIR2003SC2120 , this Court held that the rule of<br />
exclusion of writ jurisdiction by availability of<br />
alternative remedy is a rule of discretion and not one of<br />
compulsion and the Court must consider the pros and<br />
cons of the case and then may interfere if it comes to<br />
the conclusion that the petitioner seeks enforcement of<br />
any of the fundamental rights; where there is failure of<br />
principles of natural justice or where the orders or<br />
proceedings are wholly without jurisdiction or the vires<br />
of an Act is challenged.<br />
22. In G. Veerappa Pillai v. Raman &#038; Raman Ltd.<br />
[1952]1SCR583 ; Assistant Collector of Central Excise<br />
v. Dunlop India Ltd. 1985ECR4(SC); Ramendra Kishore<br />

Jaspal Singh AIR1999SC2859 and Punjab National Bank<br />
v. O.C. Krishnan and Ors. AIR2001SC3208 , this Court<br />
held that where hierarchy of appeals is provided by the<br />
statute, party must exhaust the statutory remedies<br />
before resorting to writ jurisdiction.<br />
23. Where under a statute there is an allegation of<br />
infringement of fundamental rights or when on the<br />
undisputed facts the taxing authorities are shown to<br />
have assumed jurisdiction which they do not possess<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(130 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
can be the grounds on which the writ petitions can be<br />
entertained. But normally, the High Court should not<br />
entertain writ petitions unless it is shown that there is<br />
something more in a case, something going to the root<br />
of the jurisdiction of the officer, something which would<br />
show that it would be a case of palpable injustice to the<br />
writ petitioner to force him to adopt the remedies<br />
provided by the statute. It was noted by this Court in L.<br />
Hirday Narain v. Income Tax Officer, Bareilly<br />
[1970]78ITR26(SC) that if the High Court had<br />
entertained a petition despite availability of alternative<br />
remedy and heard the parties on merits it would be<br />
ordinarily unjustifiable for the High Court to dismiss the<br />
same on the ground of non exhaustion of statutory<br />
remedies; unless the High Court finds that factual<br />
disputes are involved and it would not be desirable to<br />
deal with them in a writ petition.<br />
65. In the case of Commissioner of Income Tax and Ors. vs.<br />
Chhabil Dass Agarwal: (supra), the Supreme Court observed<br />
thus:<br />
13. In Nivedita Sharma v. Cellular Operators Assn. of<br />
India (2011) 14 SCC 337, this Court has held that<br />
where hierarchy of appeals is provided by the statute,<br />
party must exhaust the statutory remedies before<br />
resorting to writ jurisdiction for relief and observed as<br />
follows:<br />
“12. In Thansingh Nathmal v. Supdt. of Taxes AIR<br />
1964 SC 1419 this Court adverted to the rule of selfimposed<br />
restraint that the writ petition will not be<br />
entertained if an effective remedy is available to<br />
the aggrieved person and observed: (AIR p. 1423,<br />
para 7).<br />
7. &#8230; The High Court does not therefore act as a<br />
court of appeal against the decision of a court or<br />
tribunal, to correct errors of fact, and does not by<br />
assuming jurisdiction under Article 226 trench upon an<br />
alternative remedy provided by statute for obtaining<br />
relief. Where it is open to the aggrieved Petitioner to<br />
move another tribunal, or even itself in another<br />
jurisdiction for obtaining redress in the manner<br />
provided by a statute, the High Court normally will not<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(131 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
permit by entertaining a petition under Article 226 of<br />
the Constitution the machinery created under the<br />
statute to be bypassed, and will leave the party<br />
applying to it to seek resort to the machinery so set<br />
up.<br />
13. In Titaghur Paper Mills Co. Ltd. v. State<br />
of Orissa (1983) 2 SCC 433 this Court<br />
observed: (SCC pp. 440-41, para 11)<br />
11. &#8230; It is now well recognised that where<br />
a right or liability is created by a statute<br />
which gives a special remedy for enforcing<br />
it, the remedy provided by that statute<br />
only must be availed of. This rule was<br />
stated with great clarity by Willes, J. in<br />
Wolverhampton New Waterworks Co. v.<br />
Hawkesford 141 ER 486 in the following<br />
passage: (ER p. 495)<br />
&#8230; There are three classes of cases in<br />
which a liability may be established<br />
founded upon a statute. &#8230; But there is a<br />
third class viz. where a liability not existing<br />
at common law is created by a statute<br />
which at the same time gives a special and<br />
particular remedy for enforcing it.<br />
&#8230;The remedy provided by the statute<br />
must be followed, and it is not competent<br />
to the party to pursue the course<br />
applicable to cases of the second class. The<br />
form given by the statute must be adopted<br />
and adhered to.<br />
The rule laid down in this passage was approved by the<br />
House of Lords in Neville v. London Express<br />
Newspapers Ltd. 1919 AC 368 and has been reaffirmed<br />
by the Privy Council in Attorney General of Trinidad and<br />
Tobago v. Gordon Grant and Co. Ltd. 1935 AC 532 (PC)<br />
and Secy. of State v. Mask and Co. AIR 1940 PC 105 It<br />
has also been held to be equally applicable to<br />
enforcement of rights, and has been followed by this<br />
Court throughout. The High Court was therefore<br />
justified in dismissing the writ petitions in limine.<br />
14. In Mafatlal Industries Ltd. v. Union of<br />
India(1997) 5 SCC 536 B.P. Jeevan Reddy, J.<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(132 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
(speaking for the majority of the larger Bench)<br />
observed: (SCC p. 607, para 77)<br />
77. &#8230; So far as the jurisdiction of the High Court<br />
under Article 226&#8211;or for that matter, the<br />
jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32&#8211;is<br />
concerned, it is obvious that the provisions of the<br />
Act cannot bar and curtail these remedies. It is,<br />
however, equally obvious that while exercising the<br />
power under Article 226/Article 32, the Court would<br />
certainly take note of the legislative intent manifested<br />
in the provisions of the Act and would exercise<br />
their jurisdiction consistent with the provisions of<br />
the enactment.<br />
16. In the instant case, the Act provides complete<br />
machinery for the assessment/re-assessment of<br />
tax, imposition of penalty and for obtaining relief in<br />
respect of any improper orders passed by the<br />
Revenue Authorities, and the Assessee could not be<br />
permitted to abandon that machinery and to invoke<br />
the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of<br />
the Constitution when he had adequate remedy open to<br />
him by an appeal to the Commissioner of Income Tax<br />
(Appeals). The remedy under the statute, however,<br />
must be effective and not a mere formality with no<br />
substantial relief. In Ram and Shyam Co. v. State of<br />
Haryana (1985) 3 SCC 267 this Court has noticed<br />
that if an appeal is from &#8220;Caesar to Caesar&#8217;s wife&#8221; the<br />
existence of alternative remedy would be a mirage<br />
and an exercise in futility.<br />
66. In the case of Harbanslal Sahnia and Ors. vs. Indian Oil<br />
Corpn. Ltd. and Ors. (supra), the Supreme Court held thus:<br />
“7. So far as the view taken by the High Court that the<br />
remedy by way of recourse to arbitration clause was<br />
available to the appellants and therefore the writ<br />
petition filed by the appellants was liable to be<br />
dismissed, suffice it to observe that the rule of<br />
exclusion of writ jurisdiction by availability of an<br />
alternative remedy is a rule of discretion and not one of<br />
compulsion. In an appropriate case in spite of<br />
availability of the alternative remedy, the High Court<br />
may still exercise its writ jurisdiction in at least three<br />
contingencies: (i) where the writ petition seeks<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(133 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights; (ii)<br />
where there is failure of principles of natural justice or,<br />
(iii) where the orders or proceedings are wholly without<br />
jurisdiction or the vires of an Act and is challenged<br />
[See Whirlpool Corporation v. Registrar of Trade Marks,<br />
Mumbai and Ors., AIR1999SC22 . The present case<br />
attracts applicability of first two contingencies.<br />
Moreover, as noted, the petitioners&#8217; dealership, which is<br />
their bread and butter came to be terminated for an<br />
irrelevant and non-existent cause. In such<br />
circumstances, we feel that the appellants should have<br />
been allowed relief by the High Court itself instead of<br />
driving them to the need of initiating arbitration<br />
proceedings.<br />
67. In the case of Whirlpool Corporation vs. Registrar of<br />
Trade Marks, Mumbai and Ors.: (supra) , the Supreme Court<br />
held thus:<br />
“51. It is in the background of the above provisions<br />
that the question relating to the jurisdiction of the<br />
&#8220;Registrar&#8221; and the &#8220;High Court&#8221;, which individually and<br />
separately constitute &#8220;TRIBUNAL&#8221; within the meaning<br />
of Section 2(1)(x), has to be considered.<br />
52. The functions and extent of jurisdiction of the<br />
registrar and that of the High Court which, incidentally,<br />
has also been constituted as the appellate authority of<br />
the Registrar, have been distinctly set out in different<br />
provisions of the Act. There are, however, certain<br />
matters for which jurisdiction has been given to the<br />
&#8220;TRIBUNAL&#8221; which, by its definition, includes the &#8220;High<br />
Court&#8221; and the &#8220;Registrar&#8221; and therefore, the question<br />
is &#8220;can both be said to have &#8220;concurrent&#8221; jurisdiction<br />
over matters as are set out for example, in Sections 9,<br />
10, 26, 45, 46, 47 and 56&#8243;.<br />
53. If the proceeding is cognisable both by the<br />
Registrar and the High Court, which of the two will have<br />
jurisdiction to entertain such proceeding to the<br />
exclusion of the other or the jurisdiction being<br />
concurrent, can the proceeding go on simultaneously<br />
before the High Court and the Registrar, resulting, may<br />
be, in conflicting decisions at the end, is a question<br />
which seems to be answered by the words &#8220;before<br />
which the proceeding concerned is pending&#8221; occurring<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(134 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
in the definition of &#8220;TRIBUNAL&#8221; in Section 2(1)(x) of the<br />
Act. Let us test whether the answer is correct.<br />
54. Section 56 contemplates proceedings of varying<br />
nature. The proceedings contemplated by Sub-section<br />
(1) relate to the cancellation of Trade Mark or varying<br />
the registration of Trade Mark, on the ground that the<br />
condition on which the registration was granted, was<br />
either violated or there was failure in observing the<br />
condition of registration. These proceedings may be<br />
entertained either by the High Court or the Registrar on<br />
the application, and, at the instance, of the &#8220;person<br />
aggrieved&#8221;.<br />
55. The proceedings contemplated by Sub-section (2)<br />
of Section 56 relate to the absence or omission of an<br />
entry in the Register or an entry having been made<br />
without sufficient cause or an entry wrongly remaining<br />
on the Register or there being any error or defect in an<br />
entry in the Register. Such proceedings may also be<br />
entertained either by the Registrar or the High Court on<br />
an application made in the prescribed manner by a<br />
&#8220;person aggrieved&#8221;. The High Court or the registrar<br />
may, in these proceedings, pass an order either for<br />
making an entry, or expunging or varying the entry. In<br />
these proceedings which may be pending either before<br />
the High court or the Registrar, it would be open to<br />
either of them to decide any further question which<br />
may be necessary or expedient to decide in connection<br />
with the rectification of the Register. Obviously, this<br />
gives very wide jurisdiction to the High Court or the<br />
Registrar working as a Tribunal as the jurisdiction is not<br />
limited to the proceedings pending under Sub-section<br />
(1) or Sub-section (2) but extends also to decide, in<br />
the same proceedings, any other question which may<br />
legitimately arise in connection with the rectification<br />
proceedings.<br />
56. The jurisdiction conferred on the High Court or the<br />
Registrar under Sub-section (1) or Sub-section (2) can<br />
also be exercised suo motu subject to the condition<br />
that a notice is issued to the parties concerned and an<br />
opportunity of hearing is given to them before passing<br />
any order contemplated by Subsection (1) or Subsection<br />
(2).<br />
57. The Registrar and the High Court have also been<br />
given the jurisdiction under this Section to order that a<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(135 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
Trade Mark registered in Part A shall be shifted to Part<br />
B of the Register.<br />
58. An order of rectification, if passed by the High<br />
Court, is implemented by the Registrar by rectifying the<br />
Register in conformity with the order passed by the<br />
High Court.<br />
59. The extent of jurisdiction conferred by Section 56<br />
on the Registrar to rectify the Register, is, however<br />
curtailed by Section 107 which provides that an<br />
application for rectification shall, in certain situations,<br />
be made only to the High Court. These situations are<br />
mentioned in Sub-section (1) of Section 107, namely,<br />
where in a suit for infringement of the registered Trade<br />
Mark, the validity of the registration is questioned by<br />
the defendant or the defendant, in that suit, raises the<br />
defence contemplated by Section 30(1)(d) in which the<br />
acts which do not constitute an infringement, have<br />
been specified, and the plaintiff in reply to this defence<br />
questions the validity of the defendant&#8217;s Trade Mark. In<br />
these situations, the validity of the registration of the<br />
Trade Mark can be determined only by the High Court<br />
and not by the Registrar.<br />
60. Section 107 thus impels the proceedings to be<br />
instituted only in the High Court. The jurisdiction of the<br />
Registrar in those cases which are covered by Section<br />
107 is totally excluded. Significantly, Section 107(2)<br />
provides that if an application for rectification is made<br />
to the registrar Under Section 46 or Section 47(4) or<br />
Section 56, the Registrar may, if he thinks fit, refer that<br />
application, at any stage of the proceeding, to the High<br />
Court.<br />
61. Similarly, Under Section 111 of the Act, in a<br />
pending suit relating to infringement of a Trade Mark, if<br />
it is brought to the notice of the Court that any<br />
rectification proceedings relating to plaintiffs or<br />
defendant&#8217;s trade Mark are pending either before the<br />
Registrar or the High Court, the proceedings in the suit<br />
shall be stayed pending final decision of the High Court<br />
or the Registrar. Even if such proceedings are not<br />
pending either before the Registrar or the High Court,<br />
the trial court, if pritna facie satisfied that the plea<br />
regarding invalidity of plaintiff s or defendant&#8217;s Trade<br />
Mark is tenable, may frame an issue and adjourn the<br />
case for three months to enable the party concerned to<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(136 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
apply to the High Court for rectification of the Register.<br />
If within three months, the party concerned does not<br />
approach the High Court, the plea regarding invalidity<br />
of Trade Mark would be treated as abandoned but if<br />
such an application has been given hearing,, the suit<br />
would be stayed awaiting final decision of the High<br />
Court. The finding of the High Court would bind the<br />
parties and the issue relating to the invalidity of Trade<br />
Mark would be decided in terms of those findings.<br />
62. In this background, the phrase &#8220;before which the<br />
proceeding concerned is pending&#8221; stands out<br />
prominently to convey the idea that if the proceeding is<br />
pending before the &#8220;Registrar&#8221;, it becomes the<br />
&#8220;TRIBUNAL&#8221; Similarly, if the proceeding is pending<br />
before the &#8220;High Court&#8221;, then the High Court has to be<br />
treated as &#8220;TRIBUNAL&#8221;. Thus, the jurisdiction of the<br />
Registrar and the High Court, though apparently<br />
concurrent in certain matters, is mutually exclusive.<br />
That is to say, if a particular proceeding is pending<br />
before the registrar, any other proceeding, which may,<br />
in any way, relate to the pending proceeding, will have<br />
to be initiated before and taken up by the Registrar and<br />
the High Court will act as the Appellate Authority of the<br />
Registrar Under Section 109: It is obvious that if the<br />
proceedings are pending before the High Court, the<br />
registrar will keep his hands off and not touch those or<br />
any other proceedings which may, in any way, relate to<br />
those proceedings, as the High Court, which has to be<br />
the High Court having jurisdiction as set out in Section<br />
3, besides being the Appellate Authority of the<br />
Registrar has primacy over the Registrar in all matters<br />
under the Act. Any other interpretation of the definition<br />
of &#8220;TRIBUNAL&#8221; would not be in consonance with the<br />
scheme of the Act or the contextual background set out<br />
therein and may lead to conflicting decision on the<br />
same question by the Registrar and the High Court<br />
besides generating multiplicity of proceedings.<br />
63. Learned counsel for the respondent &#8211; Chinar Trust,<br />
at this stage, invoked the Rule of Punctuation in English<br />
Grammar and contended that the definition of<br />
&#8220;TRIBUNAL&#8221; is amply clear and requires no<br />
interpretative exercise as there is a distinction between<br />
the &#8220;Registrar&#8221; and the &#8220;High Court&#8221; inasmuch as the<br />
Registrar will have jurisdiction irrespective of the<br />
pendency of any proceeding, the High Court will have<br />
jurisdiction only when &#8220;proceeding concerned is<br />

pending before it. This he tried to show by pointing out<br />
that the words &#8220;as the case may be&#8221; are placed<br />
between two commas, one at the beginning<br />
immediately after the word &#8220;Registrar&#8221; and the other at<br />
the end, with the result that the words &#8220;Tribunal means<br />
the Registrar&#8221; stand out distinctly, while the words<br />
&#8220;High Court before which the proceeding concerned is<br />
pending&#8221; stand out separately as an independent<br />
phrase. It is contended that the words &#8220;before which<br />
the proceeding concerned is pending&#8221; will not be<br />
applicable to the Registrar and, therefore, the Registrar<br />
can exercise the jurisdiction Under Section 56<br />
irrespective of pendency of any &#8220;proceeding&#8221;.<br />
68. In the case of Vodafone International Holdings B.V. vs.<br />
Union of India (UOI) and Ors.: (supra) , the Supreme Court<br />
held thus:<br />
3. In the facts and circumstances of this case, thus, we<br />
are of the opinion that the question in regard to the<br />
jurisdictional issue, may be determined, by the<br />
authority concerned as a preliminary issue, in terms of<br />
the decision of this Court in Management of Express<br />
Newspapers (Private) Ltd., Madras v. The Workers and<br />
Ors. (1962)IILLJ227SC , Wherein this Court has held as<br />
under:<br />
(15) The High Court undoubtedly has jurisdiction to ask<br />
the Industrial Tribunal to stay its hands and to embark<br />
upon the preliminary enquiry itself. The jurisdiction of<br />
the High Court to adopt this course cannot be, and is<br />
indeed not disputed. But would it be proper for the<br />
High Court to adopt such a course unless the ends of<br />
justice seen to makes is necessary to do so? Normally,<br />
the questions of fact, though they may be jurisdictional<br />
facts the decision of which depends upon the<br />
appreciation of evidence, should, be left to be tried by<br />
the Special Tribunals constituted for that purpose. If<br />
and after the Special Tribunals try the preliminary issue<br />
in respect of such jurisdictional facts, it would be open<br />
to the aggrieved party to take that matter before the<br />
High Court by a writ petition and ask for an appropriate<br />
writ. Speaking generally, it would not be proper or<br />
appropriate that the initial jurisdiction of the Special<br />
Tribunal to deal with these jurisdictional facts should be<br />
circumvented and the decision of such a preliminary<br />
issue brought before a High Court in its writ<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />

jurisdiction. We wish to point out that in making these<br />
observations, we do not propose to lay down any fixed<br />
or inflexible rule; whether or not even the preliminary<br />
facts should be tried by a High Court in a writ petition,<br />
must naturally depend upon the circumstances of each<br />
case and upon the nature of the preliminary issue<br />
raised between the parties. Having regard to the<br />
circumstances of the present dispute, we think the<br />
Court of Appeal was right in taking the view that the<br />
preliminary issue should more appropriately be dealt<br />
with by the Tribunal. The Appeal Court has made it<br />
clear that any party who feels aggrieved by the finding<br />
of the Tribunal on this preliminary issue may move the<br />
High Court in accordance with law. Therefore, we are<br />
not prepared to accept Mr. Shastri&#8217;s argument that the<br />
appeal Court was wrong in reversing the conclusion of<br />
the Trial Judge in so far as the Trial Judge proceeded to<br />
deal with the question as to whether the action of the<br />
appellant was a closure or a lockout.<br />
69. In the case of The Management of Express Newspapers<br />
Ltd. vs. Workers and Staff Employed under it and Ors.: , the<br />
(supra) Supreme Court held thus:<br />
“6…………..In regard to the main point of controversy<br />
between the parties as to the validity of the reference<br />
itself, the Appeal Court took the view that the questions<br />
which had to be decided in dealing with the appellant&#8217;s<br />
contention that the reference was invalid, were<br />
complex questions of fact and that it would be<br />
appropriate that the said questions should be fully<br />
investigated and tried in the first instance by the<br />
Industrial Tribunal itself. In other words, the Appeal<br />
Court held that though the High Court had jurisdiction<br />
to entertain an application for a writ of Prohibition even<br />
at the initial stage of the proceedings commenced<br />
before a Special Tribunal, it would not be proper that a<br />
writ of prohibition should be issued unless the disputed<br />
questions of fact were tried by the said Special Tribunal<br />
in the first instance. On this view, the order passed by<br />
the trial Judge has been modified and the disputes<br />
referred to the Industrial Tribunal for its adjudication<br />
have been remitted to the said Tribunal for its disposed<br />
in accordance with law. In making this Order, the<br />
Appeal Court has indicated the nature of the dispute<br />
and the questions of fact which the Industrial Tribunal<br />
may have to try and the limits of its jurisdiction. In the<br />

result, the writ apple No. 73/1959 succeeded whereas<br />
writ appeal No. 85/1959 failed. It is this decision of the<br />
Court of Appeal that is challenged before us by Mr.<br />
Viswanatha Sastri on behalf of the appellant.<br />

70. In Raghuvinder Singh Vs Dy. Commissioner Of Income<br />
Tax, (Benami Transaction) And Initiating Officer (supra )<br />
Under The Prevention Of Benami Transaction Act 2016, this Court<br />
observed thus:<br />
Grounds have been raised regarding non-compliance of<br />
principles of natural justice as well as non-compliance<br />
of the provisions contained under the Benami<br />
Transaction (Prohibition) Act, 1988, specially Section 24<br />
with regard to service of notice and also with regard to<br />
application of mind relating to the order of approval.<br />
Having noted the aforesaid, this Court finds that it<br />
would not be appropriate for this Court at this stage to<br />
examine the veracity and legality of the notice of<br />
attachment issued way back as on 22/12/2017 as of<br />
now as the matter is already pending before the<br />
adjudicating authority. However, all the objections,<br />
which the petitioner has raised before this Court, can<br />
be taken up by him before the adjudicating authority<br />
and it would be for the adjudicating authority to decide<br />
and examine all the objections and pass a reasoned<br />
order. It is expected from the adjudicating authority to<br />
give reasonable time to the petitioner to put up his<br />
objections in writing and examine the entire issue<br />
thread-bear after giving fair opportunity to all the<br />
parties.<br />
71. In Great Pacific General Trading Company (Limited<br />
Liability Partnership), Vs. Union of India, Through the<br />
Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Department of Revenue,<br />
(supra), it has been observed thus:<br />
“It is contended that the transaction questioned by the<br />
respondent No.3 in the order dated 18.11.2017 does<br />
not fall in the category of benami transaction.<br />
After hearing learned counsel for the petitioner and<br />
after perusing the material available on record and the<br />
order dated 18.11.2017 passed by the Initiating Officer<br />
under Section 24(4) of the PBPT Act, it cannot be said<br />
that the respondent No.3 has passed the order dated<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(141 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
18.11.2017 without there being any material on record.<br />
This Court at this stage cannot record a finding to the<br />
effect that Shri Aditya Lodha cannot be termed as<br />
benamidar or the property in question is not a benami<br />
property. It is for the adjudicating authority to<br />
adjudicate upon the matter, referred to it by the<br />
Initiating Officer, after providing opportunity of hearing<br />
to Shri Aditya Lodha as per the provisions of Section 26<br />
of the PBPT Act.<br />
72. The above judgement was challenged in D.B. Spl. Appl. Writ<br />
No. 1315/2018, decided on 22/10/2018: Great Pacific General<br />
Trading Company (Limited Liability Partnership) Vs. Union<br />
of India, through the Secretary, Ministry of Finance,<br />
Department of Revenue holding thus:<br />
“We are constraint to note that the averments made in<br />
para 5 of the Special Appeal are factual. As per the said<br />
reply to para 5, Shri Aditya Lodha and his son Shri<br />
Manan Lodha retired on 01.06.2015 and only Shri<br />
Tarachand Parakh and his son Shri Aditya Parakh<br />
remained the partners in the LLP till 10.07.2017.<br />
During this period, the transactions were carried out by<br />
Shri Aditya Lodha alone and Shri Tara Chand Parakh<br />
and his son Shri Aditya Parakh were not even aware of<br />
the said transactions, which has given rise to bonafide<br />
suspicion that the property is benami property. Hence,<br />
we agree with the learned Single Judge that in case, we<br />
go into the same at this stage, it would effect the<br />
finding with respect to the property as to whether the<br />
same was benami or not. Accordingly, no ground is<br />
made out to interfere in the order impugned.”<br />
73. In the case , Dheeru Gond Vs. Union of India(supra),<br />
High Court of Madhya Pradesh held thus:<br />
“It is apparent that the learned Single Judge of this<br />
Court in WP No.10280/2017 filed by one Kailash<br />
Assudani challenging the show cause notice of similar<br />
nature has dismissed the petition holding that the<br />
provision of Section 26 of the Act, 1988 is a complete<br />
code in itself providing ample opportunities to the<br />
assessee concerned, and apart from that there is<br />
remedy of appeal available to the petitioner. The order<br />
passed by the learned Single a Judge of this Court in<br />
WP No.10280/2017 has been confirmed by the Division<br />
Bench of this Court in WA No.704/2017 with the ad<br />
following observations:-<br />

(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(142 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
We do not find any merit in the present M<br />
appeal. It is the Adjudicating Authority who<br />
is to decide the question of Benami nature<br />
of the property. The proceedings under<br />
Section 24 of the Act contemplates the<br />
issuance of show cause notice as to why<br />
the property specified in the notice should<br />
not be treated as Benami property.<br />
However, the substantive order of treating<br />
the property as Benami is required to be<br />
passed by Adjudicating Authority under<br />
Section 26 C of the Act only. Therefore, the<br />
appellant is at liberty to take all such plea<br />
of law and facts as may be available to the<br />
appellant before the Adjudicating Authority.<br />
The Adjudicating Authority shall decide the<br />
Benami nature of the property in<br />
accordance with law.<br />
74. In the case of WA-704-2017, Kailash Assudani vs<br />
Commissioner Of Income Tax: decided on 16 August, 2017, it<br />
has been observed thus:<br />
“We do not find any merit in the present appeal. It is<br />
the Adjudicating Authority who is to decide the<br />
question of Benami nature of the property. The<br />
proceedings under Section 24 of the Act contemplates<br />
the issuance of show cause notice as to why the<br />
property specified in the notice should not be treated<br />
as Benami property. However, the substantive order of<br />
treating the property as Benami is required to be<br />
passed by Adjudicating Authority under Section 26 of<br />
the Act only. Therefore, the appellant is at liberty to<br />
take all such plea of law and facts as may be available<br />
to the appellant before the Adjudicating Authority. The<br />
Adjudicating Authority shall decide the Benami nature<br />
of the property in accordance with law.”<br />
75. In the case of R. Rajagopal Reddy (Dead) by L.Rs. and<br />
Ors. (supra), it has been held thus:<br />
“11. Before we deal with these six considerations which<br />
weighed with the Division Bench for taking the view<br />
that Section 4 will apply retrospectively in the sense<br />
that it will get telescoped into all pending proceedings,<br />
howsoever earlier they might have been filed, if they<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(143 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
were pending at different stages in the hierarchy of the<br />
proceedings even upto this Court, when Section 4 came<br />
into operation, it would be apposite to recapitulate the<br />
salient feature of the Act. As seen earlier, the preamble<br />
of the Act itself states that it is an act to prohibit<br />
benami transactions and the right to recover property<br />
held benami, for matters connected therewith or<br />
incidental thereto. Thus it was enacted to efface the<br />
then existing rights of the real owners of properties<br />
held by others benami. Such an act was not given any<br />
retrospective effect by the legislature. Even when we<br />
come to Section 4, it is easy to visualise that Subsection<br />
(1). of Section 4 states that no suit, claim or<br />
action to enforce any right in respect of any property<br />
held benami against the person in whose name the<br />
property is held or against any other shall lie by or on<br />
behalf of a person claiming to be the real owner of such<br />
property. As per Section 4(1) no such suit shall<br />
thenceforth lie to recover the possession of the<br />
property held benami by the defendant. Plaintiffs right<br />
to that effect is sought to be taken away and any suit<br />
to enforce such a right after coming into operation of<br />
Section 4(1) that is 19th May, 1988, shall not lie. The<br />
legislature in its wisdom has nowhere provided in<br />
Section 4(1) that no such suit, claim or action pending<br />
on the date when Section 4 came into force shall not be<br />
proceeded with and shall stand abated. On the<br />
contrary, clear legislative intention is seen from the<br />
words &#8220;no such claim, suit or action shall lie&#8221;, meaning<br />
thereby no such suit, claim or action shall be permitted<br />
to be filed or entertained or admitted to the portals of<br />
any Court for seeking such a relief after coming into<br />
force of Section 4(1). In Collins English Dictionary,<br />
1979 Edition as reprinted subsequently, the word &#8216;lie&#8217;<br />
has been defined in connection with suits and<br />
proceedings. At page 848 of the Dictionary while<br />
dealing with topic No. 9 under the definition of term &#8216;lie&#8217;<br />
it is stated as under :-<br />
For an action, claim appeal ect. to subsist; be<br />
maintainable or admissible.<br />
The word &#8216;lie&#8217; in connection with the suit, claim or<br />
action is not defined by the Act. If we go by the<br />
aforesaid dictionary meaning it would mean that such<br />
suit, claim or action to get any property declared<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(144 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
benami will not be admitted on behalf of such plaintiff<br />
or applicant against the concerned defendant in whose<br />
name the property is held on and from the date on<br />
which this prohibition against entertaining of such suits<br />
comes into force. With respect, the view taken by that<br />
Section 4(1) would apply even to such pending suits<br />
which were already filed and entertained prior to the<br />
date when the Section came into force and which has<br />
the effect of destroying the then existing right of<br />
plaintiff in connection with the suit property cannot be<br />
sustained in the face of the clear language of Section<br />
4(1). It has to be visualised that the legislature in its<br />
wisdom has not expressly made Section 4<br />
retrospective. Then to imply by necessary implication<br />
that Section 4 would have retrospective effect and<br />
would cover pending litigations filed prior to coming<br />
into force of the Section would amount to taking a view<br />
which would run counter to the legislative scheme and<br />
intent projected by various provisions of the Act to<br />
which we have referred earlier. It is, however, true as<br />
held by the Division Bench that on the express<br />
language of Section 4(1) any right inhering in the real<br />
owner in respect of any property held benami would<br />
get effaced once Section 4(1) operated, even if such<br />
transaction had been entered into prior to the coming<br />
into operation of Section 4(1), and hence-after Section<br />
4(1) applied no suit can lie in respect to such a past<br />
benami transaction. To that extent the Section may be<br />
retroactive. To highlight this aspect we may take an<br />
illustration. If a benami transaction has taken place in<br />
1980 and suit is filed in June 1988 by the plaintiff<br />
claiming that he is the real owner of the property and<br />
defendant is merely a benamidar and the consideration<br />
has flown from him then such a suit would not lie on<br />
account of the provisions of Section 4(1). Bar against<br />
filing, entertaining and admission of such suits would<br />
have become operative by June, 1988 and to that<br />
extent Section 4(1) would take in its sweep even past<br />
benami transactions which are sought to be litigated<br />
upon after coming into force of the prohibitory<br />
provision of Section 4(1); but that is the only effect of<br />
the retroactivity of Section 4(1) and nothing more than<br />
that. From the conclusion that Section 4(1) shall apply<br />
even to past benami transactions to the aforesaid<br />
extent, the next step taken by the Division Bench that<br />
therefore, the then existing rights got destroyed and<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(145 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
even though suits by real owners were filed prior to<br />
coming into operation of Section 4(1) they would not<br />
survive, does not logically follow.<br />
12. So far as Section 4(2) is concerned, all that is<br />
provided is that if a suit is filed by a plaintiff who claims<br />
in his favour and holds the property in his name, once<br />
Section 4(2) applies, no defence will be permitted or<br />
allowed in any such suit, claim or action by or on behalf<br />
of a person claiming to be the real owner of such<br />
property held benami. The disallowing of such a<br />
defence which earlier was available, itself, suggests<br />
that a new liability or restriction is imposed by Section<br />
4(2) on a pre- existing right of the defendant. Such a<br />
provision also cannot be said to be retrospective or<br />
retroactive by necessary implication. It is also pertinent<br />
to note that Section 4(2) does not expressly seek to<br />
apply retrospectively. So far as such a suit which is<br />
covered by the sweep of Section 4(2) is concerned, the<br />
prohibition of Section 4(1) cannot apply to it as it is not<br />
a claim or action filed by the plaintiff to enforce right in<br />
respect of any property held benami. On the contrary,<br />
it is a suit, claim or action flowing from the sale deed or<br />
title deed in the name of the plaintiff. Even though such<br />
a suit have been filed prior to 19.5.1988, if before the<br />
stage of filing of defence by the real owner is reached,<br />
Section 4(2) becomes operative from 19th May, 1988,<br />
then such a defence, as laid down by Section 4(2) will<br />
not be allowed to such a defendant. However, that<br />
would not mean that Section 4(1) and 4(2) only on that<br />
score can be treated to be impliedly retrospective so as<br />
to cover all the pending litigations in connection with<br />
enforcement of such rights of real owners who are<br />
parties to benami transactions entered into prior to the<br />
coming into operation of the Act and specially Section 4<br />
thereof. It is also pertinent to note that Section 4(2)<br />
enjoins that no such defence &#8216;shall be allowed&#8217; in any<br />
claim, suit or action by or on behalf of a person<br />
claiming to be the real owner of such property. That is<br />
to say no such defence shall be allowed for the first<br />
time after coming into operation of Section 4(2). If<br />
such a defence is already allowed in a pending suit<br />
prior to the coming into operation of Section 4(2),<br />
enabling an issue to be raised on such a defence, then<br />
the Court is bound to decide the issue arising from such<br />
an already allowed defence as at the relevant time<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(146 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
when such defence was allowed Section 4(2) was out of<br />
picture. Section 4(2) nowhere uses the words &#8220;No<br />
defence based on any right in respect of any property<br />
held benami whether against the person in whose<br />
name the property is held or against any other person,<br />
shall be allowed to be raised or continued to be raised<br />
in any suit.&#8221; With respect, it was wrongly assumed by<br />
the Division Bench that such an already allowed<br />
defence in a pending suit would also get destroyed<br />
after coming into operation of Section 4(2). We may at<br />
this stage refer to one difficulty projected by learned<br />
advocate for the respondents in his written<br />
submissions, on the applicability of Section 4(2). These<br />
submissions read as under:-<br />
Section 4(1) places a bar on a plaintiff<br />
pleading &#8216;benami&#8217;, while Section 4(2)<br />
places a bar on a defendant pleading<br />
&#8216;benami&#8217;, after the coming into force of the<br />
Act. In this context, it would be anomalous<br />
if the bar in Section 4 is not applicable if a<br />
suit pleading &#8216;benami&#8217; is already filed prior<br />
to the prescribed date, and it is treated as<br />
applicable only to suit which he filed<br />
thereafter. It would have the effect of<br />
classifying the so-called &#8216;real&#8217; owners into<br />
two classes &#8211; those who stand in the<br />
position of plaintiffs and those who stand in<br />
the position of defendants. This may be<br />
clarified by means of an illustration. A and<br />
B are &#8216;real&#8217; owners who have both<br />
purchased properties in say 1970, in the<br />
names of C and D respectively who are<br />
ostensible owners viz. benamidars. A files<br />
a suit in February 1988 i.e. before the<br />
coming into force of the Act against C, for<br />
a declaration of his title saying that C is<br />
actually holding it as his benamidar.<br />
According to the petitioner&#8217;s argument,<br />
such a plea would be open to A even after<br />
coming into force of the Act, since the suit<br />
has already been laid. On the other hand,<br />
if D files a suit against B at the same for<br />
declaration and injunction, claiming himself<br />
to be the owner but B&#8217;s opportunity to file<br />
a written statement comes in say<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(147 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
November 1988 when the Act has already<br />
come into force, he in his written<br />
statement cannot plead that D is a<br />
benamidar and that he, B is the real owner.<br />
Thus A and B, both &#8216;real&#8217; owners, would<br />
stand on a different footing, depending<br />
upon whether they would stand in the<br />
position of plaintiff or defendant. It is<br />
respectfully submitted that such a<br />
differential treatment would not be rational<br />
or logical.<br />
13. According to us this difficulty is inbuilt in Section<br />
4(2) and does not provide the rationale to hold that<br />
this Section applies retrospectively. The legislature<br />
itself thought it fit to do so and there is no challenge to<br />
the vires on the ground of violation of Article 14 of the<br />
Constitution. It is not open to us to re-write the section<br />
also. Even otherwise, in the operation of Section 4(1)<br />
and (2), no discrimination can be said to have been<br />
made amongst different real owners of property, as<br />
tried to be pointed out in the written objections. In<br />
fact, those cases in which suits are filed by real owners<br />
or defences are allowed prior to corning into operation<br />
of Section 4(2), would form a separate class as<br />
compared to those cases where a stage for filing such<br />
suits or defences has still not reached by the time<br />
Section 4(1) and (2) starts operating. Consequently,<br />
latter type of cases would form a distinct category of<br />
cases. There is no question of discrimination being<br />
meted out while dealing with these two classes of cases<br />
differently. A real owner who has already been allowed<br />
defence on that ground prior to coming into operation<br />
of Section 4(2) cannot be said to have been given a<br />
better treatment as compared to the real owner who<br />
has still to take up such a defence and in the meantime<br />
he is hit by the prohibition of Section 4(2). Equally<br />
there cannot be any comparison between a real owner<br />
who has filed such suit earlier and one who does not<br />
file such suit till Section 4(1) comes into operation. All<br />
real owners who stake their claims regarding benami<br />
transactions after Section 4(1) and (2) came into<br />
operation are given uniform treatment by these<br />
provisions, whether they come as plaintiffs or as<br />
defendants. Consequently, the grievances raised in this<br />
connection cannot be sustained.”<br />

76. In the case of State Bank of Travancore and another Vs.<br />
Mathew K.C. (supra) it has been held thus:<br />
“13. In Ikbal (supra), it was observed that the action of<br />
the Bank Under Section 13(4) of the &#8216;SARFAESI Act&#8217;<br />
available to challenge by the aggrieved Under Section<br />
17 was an efficacious remedy and the institution<br />
directly Under Article 226 was not sustainable, relying<br />
upon Satyawati Tandon (Supra), observing:<br />
27. No doubt an alternative remedy is not<br />
an absolute bar to the exercise of<br />
extraordinary jurisdiction Under Article 226<br />
but by now it is well settled that where a<br />
statute provides efficacious and adequate<br />
remedy, the High Court will do well in not<br />
entertaining a petition Under Article 226.<br />
On misplaced considerations, statutory<br />
procedures cannot be allowed to be<br />
circumvented.<br />
***<br />
28&#8230;&#8230;.In our view, there was no<br />
justification whatsoever for the learned<br />
Single Judge to allow the borrower to<br />
bypass the efficacious remedy provided to<br />
him Under Section 17 and invoke the<br />
extraordinary jurisdiction in his favour<br />
when he had disentitled himself for such<br />
relief by his conduct. The Single Judge was<br />
clearly in error in invoking his<br />
extraordinary jurisdiction Under Article 226<br />
in light of the peculiar facts indicated<br />
above. The Division Bench also erred in<br />
affirming the erroneous order of the Single<br />
Judge.<br />
77. In the case of CIT, New Delhi Vs. Ram Kishan Dass<br />
(supra), the Apex Court of the land held thus:<br />
“24. We find no substance in the submission urged on<br />
behalf of the Assessees that to adopt an interpretation<br />
which we have placed on the provisions of Section<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(149 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
142(2C) would enable the assessing officer to extend<br />
the period of limitation for making an assessment<br />
Under Section 153B. Explanation (iii) to Section<br />
153B(1), as it stood at the material time, provided for<br />
the exclusion of the period commencing from the date<br />
on which the assessing officer had directed the<br />
Assessee to get his accounts audited Under Sub-section<br />
(2A) of Section 142 and ending on the day on which<br />
the assesee is required to furnish a report under that<br />
Sub-section. The day on which the Assessee is required<br />
to furnish a report of the audit Under Sub-section (2A)<br />
marks the culmination of the period of exclusion for the<br />
purpose of limitation. Where the assessing officer had<br />
extended the time, the period, commencing from the<br />
date on which the audit was ordered and ending with<br />
the date on which the Assessee is required to furnish a<br />
report, would be excluded in computing the period of<br />
limitation for framing the assessment Under Section<br />
153B. The principle governing the exclusion of time<br />
remains the same. The act on which the exclusion<br />
culminates is the date which the assessing officer fixes<br />
originally, or on extension for submission of the report.<br />
25. The issue as to whether the amendment which has<br />
been brought about by the legislature is intended to be<br />
clarificatory or to remove an ambiguity in the law must<br />
depend upon the context. The Court would have due<br />
regard to (i) the general scope and purview of the<br />
statute; (ii) the remedy sought to be applied; (iii) the<br />
former state of the law; and (iv) what power that the<br />
legislature contemplated (See Zile Singh v. State of<br />
Haryana (2004) 8 SCC 1). The decision in Sedco Forex<br />
International Drill Inc. v. Commissioner of Income Tax<br />
[2005] 279 ITR 310 (SC); (2005) 12 SCC 717 on which<br />
learned Counsel for the assesses relied involved a<br />
substitution of the Explanation to Section 9(1)(ii) of the<br />
IT Act, 1961 with effect from 1 April 2000. A two Judge<br />
Bench of this Court held that given the legislative<br />
history of Section 9(1)(ii), it can only be assumed that<br />
it was deliberately introduced with effect from 1 April<br />
2000 and was therefore intended to be prospective.<br />
This was also so construed by the CBDT, and in the<br />
explanatory notes to the provisions of the Finance Act,<br />
1999. As we have indicated, interpretation is a matter<br />
of determining the path on the basis of statutory<br />
context and legislative history. In taking the view that<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(150 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
we have, we have also taken note of the fact that the<br />
same view was adopted by several High Courts. Among<br />
them are (i) the Punjab and Haryana High Court in<br />
Jagatjit Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income<br />
Tax (1994) 74 Taxman 8 (Pun. &#038; Har.); [1994] 210 ITR<br />
468; (ii) the Kerala High Court in Commissioner of<br />
Income Tax, Cochin v. Popular Automobiles (2011) 333<br />
ITR 308; and (iii) the Allahabad High Court in<br />
Ghaziabad Development Authority v. Commissioner of<br />
Income Tax, Ghaziabad (UP) (2011) 12 Taxman.com<br />
334 (Allahabad). The decision of the Kerala High Court<br />
in Popular Automobiles (supra) is the subject matter of<br />
Civil Appeal No. 2951 of 2012 in these proceedings.<br />
78. In the case of Canbank Financial Services Ltd. vs. The<br />
Custodian and Ors. (supra), the Supreme Court observed thus:<br />
“67. The evil of benami transaction was sought to be<br />
curbed by reason of the provisions of the Urban Land<br />
(Ceiling and Regulation) Act 1976, the State Ceiling<br />
Laws, Income Tax Act 1961 as amended by the<br />
Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act 1975 (See Sections<br />
281 and 281A of the Income Tax Act), Section 5 of the<br />
Gift Tax Act 1958, Section 34B of the Wealth Tax Act<br />
and Section 5(1) of the Estate Duty Act (since<br />
repealed). It is only with that view the Benami<br />
Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988 prohibiting the<br />
right to recover benami transaction was enacted.<br />
Section 5(1) provided that all properties held benami<br />
shall be subject to acquisition as different from<br />
forfeiture provided for in the Smugglers and Foreign<br />
Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act,<br />
1976. But even Section 5 had not been made workable<br />
as no rules under Section 8 of the Act for acquisition of<br />
property held benami were framed.”<br />
79. Applying the principles deducible from the opinions of the<br />
Apex Court of the land as referred to and relied upon by the<br />
learned counsel for the parties; it is evident that High Court could<br />
interfere in exercise of writ jurisdiction, if, the conditions<br />
precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction under the statutory<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(151 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
provisions did not exist even at the stage of notice issued. Thus,<br />
the High Courts have power in appropriate cases to prohibit<br />
executive authority from acting without jurisdiction. Moreover, if<br />
executive authority exercised the power without jurisdiction that<br />
would subject an individual to lengthy proceedings and<br />
unnecessary harassment. Hence, to prevent such lengthy<br />
proceedings and unnecessary harassment, recourse to jurisdiction<br />
under Article 226 and/or227 of the Constitution is not prohibited.<br />
Further, the legislative drafting is more than an ordinary prose<br />
which differs in provenance, features and its import as to the<br />
meaning attached thereto and presumptions as to intendment of<br />
the legislation.<br />
80. By now, it is well settled law that unless a contrary intention<br />
is reflected, a legislation is presumed and intended to be<br />
prospective. For in the normal course of human behavior, one is<br />
entitled to arrange his affairs keeping in view the laws for the time<br />
being in force and such arrangement of affairs should not be<br />
dislodged by retrospective application of law. The principle of law<br />
known as lex prospicit non prospicit (law looks forward not<br />
backward), is a well known and accepted principle. The<br />
retrospective legislation is contrary to general principle for<br />
legislation by which the conduct of mankind is to be regulated<br />
when introduced for the first time to deal with future acts ought<br />
not to change the character of past transactions carried out in the<br />
faith of the then existing law (vide Phillips Vs. Eyre (1870)LR 6 QB<br />
1). Thus, the principle against retrospectivity is the principle of<br />
‘fairplay’ and unless there is a clear and unambiguous intendment<br />
for retrospective effect to the legislation which affects accrued<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(152 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
rights or imposes obligations or castes new duties or attaches a<br />
new disability is to be treated as prospective.<br />
81. It is trite law that an explanatory or declaratory Act is<br />
intended to supply an obvious omission or is enacted to clear<br />
doubts as to the meaning of the previous Act. While retrospective<br />
operation is generally intended as to declaratory or curative<br />
provisions, which is supplied with the ‘language’ &#8220;shall be deemed<br />
always to have meant&#8221;. Therefore, in absence of clarity<br />
amendment being declaratory or curative in the face of<br />
unambiguous or confusion in the pre-amended provisions; the<br />
same is not required to be treated as curative or declaratory<br />
amendment. Viewed in the light of the settled legal proposition,<br />
as aforesaid, Benami Amendment Act, 2016, neither appears to be<br />
clarificatory nor curative. Moreover, by way of amendment penal<br />
consequences have been introduced providing for confiscation of<br />
the benami property and enhanced punishment.<br />
82. In the case of Prakash and Ors. (supra), the Apex Court of<br />
the land while dealing with the very Benami Amendment Act,<br />
2016, held thus:<br />
“17. The text of the amendment itself clearly provides<br />
that the right conferred on a &#8216;daughter of a coparcener&#8217;<br />
is &#8216;on and from the commencement of Hindu<br />
Succession (Amendment) Act, 2005&#8217;. Section 6(3) talks<br />
of death after the amendment for its applicability. In<br />
view of plain language of the statute, there is no scope<br />
for a different interpretation than the one suggested by<br />
the text of the amendment. An amendment of a<br />
substantive provision is always prospective unless<br />
either expressly or by necessary intendment it is<br />
retrospective Shyam Sunder v. Ram Kumar (2001) 8<br />
SCC 24, Paras 22 to 27. In the present case, there is<br />
neither any express provision for giving retrospective<br />
effect to the amended provision nor necessary<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(153 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
intendment to that effect. Requirement of partition<br />
being registered can have no application to statutory<br />
notional partition on opening of succession as per<br />
unamended provision, having regard to nature of such<br />
partition which is by operation of law. The intent and<br />
effect of the Amendment will be considered a little<br />
later. On this finding, the view of the High Court cannot<br />
be sustained.<br />
18. Contention of the Respondents that the<br />
Amendment should be read as retrospective being a<br />
piece of social legislation cannot be accepted. Even a<br />
social legislation cannot be given retrospective effect<br />
unless so provided for or so intended by the legislature.<br />
In the present case, the legislature has expressly made<br />
the Amendment applicable on and from its<br />
commencement and only if death of the coparcener in<br />
question is after the Amendment. Thus, no other<br />
interpretation is possible in view of express language of<br />
the statute. The proviso keeping dispositions or<br />
alienations or partitions prior to 20th December, 2004<br />
unaffected can also not lead to the inference that the<br />
daughter could be a coparcener prior to the<br />
commencement of the Act. The proviso only means<br />
that the transactions not covered thereby will not affect<br />
the extent of coparcenary property which may be<br />
available when the main provision is applicable.<br />
Similarly, Explanation has to be read harmoniously with<br />
the substantive provision of Section 6(5) by being<br />
limited to a transaction of partition effected after 20th<br />
December, 2004. Notional partition, by its very nature,<br />
is not covered either under proviso or under Subsection<br />
5 or under the Explanation.”<br />
83. By now, it is well settled law that a substantive provision<br />
unless specifically made retrospective or otherwise intended by<br />
the Parliament should always be held to be prospective. The power<br />
to confiscate and consequent forfeiture of rights or interests are<br />
drastic being penal in nature, and therefore, such statutes are to<br />
be read very strictly. However, there can be no exercise of powers<br />
under such statutes by way of extension or implication (vide<br />
O.Konavalov (supra).<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(154 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
84. In the case of D.L.F. Qutab Enclave Complex Educational<br />
Charitable Trust (supra), the Apex Court of the land in no<br />
uncertain terms observed that extraordinary legislation must be<br />
strictly construed and a penal statute must receive strict<br />
construction. The Supreme Court further observed that the<br />
mischief of rule, if applied, in view of amendment made would be<br />
in infraction to the provisions of Article 20 of the Constitution of<br />
India, cannot be given retrospective effect. Similar is the position<br />
operating in the instant batch of cases at hand. The rights<br />
accrued in favour of any person owing to a transaction in the<br />
nature of contract protected under a statute, in that event<br />
transgration/violation of those rights could only be by a legislation<br />
with retrospective effect.<br />
85. In view of the settled legal proposition that no authority,<br />
much less, a quasi judicial authority, can confer jurisdiction on<br />
itself by deciding a jurisdictional fact wrongly; is a question that is<br />
always open for scrutiny by the High Court in an application under<br />
Article 226/227 of the Constitution of India. The very question of<br />
correctness and legality of the issuance of notice can be examined<br />
in exercise of writ jurisdiction.<br />
86. In the case of Mangathai Ammal (died) through L.Rs. &#038; ors.<br />
(supra), the Apex Court of the land while dealing with issue of<br />
retrospective effect of the Benami Amendment Act, 2016, in<br />
unambiguous terms held that Benami Transaction Act would not<br />
be applicable retrospectively. At this juncture, it would be<br />
relevant to take note of the text of para 12 of the said judgment<br />
which reads thus:<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(155 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
“12. It is required to be noted that the benami<br />
transaction came to be amended in the year 2016. As<br />
per Section 3 of the Benami Transaction (Prohibition)<br />
Act 1988, there was a presumption that the<br />
transaction made in the name of the wife and children<br />
is for their benefit. By Benami Amendment Act, 2016,<br />
Section 3(2) of the Benami Transaction Act, 1988 the<br />
statutory presumption, which was rebuttable, has<br />
been omitted. It is the case on behalf of the<br />
Respondents that therefore in view of omission of<br />
Section 3(2) of the Benami Transaction Act, the plea<br />
of statutory transaction that the purchase made in the<br />
name of wife or children is for their benefit would not<br />
be available in the present case. Aforesaid cannot be<br />
accepted. As held by this Court in the case of Binapani<br />
Paul (Supra) the Benami Transaction (Prohibition) Act<br />
would not be applicable retrospectively. Even<br />
otherwise and as observed hereinabove, the Plaintiff<br />
has miserably failed to discharge his onus to prove<br />
that the Sale Deeds executed in favour of Defendant<br />
No. 1 were benami transactions and the same<br />
properties were purchased in the name of Defendant<br />
No. 1 by Narayanasamy Mudaliar from the amount<br />
received by him from the sale of other ancestral<br />
properties.”<br />
87. Article 20 of the Constitution of India is fundamental right<br />
guaranteed under Part-III of the Constitution and the penal<br />
consequences emanating from the Benami Amendment Act, 2016,<br />
in infraction to the mandate of fundamental rights guaranteed<br />
under Article 20 of the Constitution; cannot be given retrospective<br />
effect in absence of a clear stipulation by the Parliament on<br />
retrospectivity.<br />
88. In the case of Joseph Isharat (supra), relying upon the<br />
opinion of the Apex Court of the land in the case of R. Rajagopal<br />
Reddy (Dead) by L.Rs. and Ors. (supra) while examining the<br />
provisions of amendment introduced by the Legislature through<br />

(156 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
Benami Amendment Act, 2016, made effective from 1st<br />
November, 2016, the Bombay High Court observed thus:<br />
4. Under the Benami Act, as it stood on the date of<br />
the suit as well as on the date of filing of written<br />
statement and passing of the decree by the courts<br />
below, provided for the definition of a &#8220;benami<br />
transaction&#8221; under clause (a) of Section 2. Under that<br />
provision, any transaction in which property is<br />
transferred to one person for consideration paid or<br />
provided by another came within the definition of<br />
&#8220;benami transaction&#8221;. Section 3 of the Benami Act, in<br />
sub-section (1), provided that no person shall enter<br />
into any benami transaction. Sub-section (2)<br />
contained two exceptions to the prohibition contained<br />
in sub-section (1). The first exception, contained in<br />
clause (a) of sub-section (2), was in respect of<br />
purchase of property by any person in the name of his<br />
wife or unmarried daughter. In the case of such<br />
purchase, it was to be presumed, unless the contrary<br />
was proved, that the property was purchased for the<br />
benefit of the wife or unmarried daughter, as the case<br />
may be. Simultaneously, Section 4 of the Benami Act<br />
contained a prohibition in respect of right to recover<br />
property held benami. Sub-section (1) provided that<br />
no suit, claim or action to enforce any right in respect<br />
of any property held benami against the person in<br />
whose name the property is held, or against any other<br />
person, shall lie by or on behalf of a person claiming<br />
to be the real owner of such property. Sub-section (2)<br />
made provisions likewise in respect of a defence<br />
based on a plea of benami transaction. Sub-section<br />
(2) provided that no defence based on any right in<br />
respect of any property held benami, whether against<br />
the person in whose name the property is held or<br />
against any other person, shall be allowed in any suit,<br />
claim or action by or on behalf of a person claiming to<br />
be the real owner of such property. There was a<br />
twofold exception to this restriction. First was in<br />
respect of the person in whose name the property is<br />
held being a coparcener in a Hindu undivided family<br />
and the property being held for the benefit of the<br />
coparceners of the family. The second exception was<br />
in respect of the person, in whose name the property<br />
was held, being a trustee or other person standing in<br />
a fiduciary capacity and the property being held for<br />
the benefit of another person for whom he was such<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(157 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
trustee or towards whom he stood in such capacity.<br />
The present suit was filed when these provisions were<br />
in operation. These provisions continued to apply even<br />
when the written statement was filed by the<br />
Defendant and the suit was heard and decreed by<br />
both the courts below. The legal provisions continued<br />
to apply even when the second appeal was filed<br />
before this court. It is only now during the pendency<br />
of the second appeal, when it has come up for final<br />
hearing, that there is a change in law. The Benami Act<br />
has been amended by the Parliament in 2016 with the<br />
passing of the Benami Transactions (Prohibition)<br />
Amendment Act, 2016. This amendment has come<br />
into effect from 01 November 2016. In the Amended<br />
Act the definition of &#8220;benami transaction&#8221; has<br />
undergone a change. Under the Amended Act &#8220;benami<br />
transaction&#8221; means (under Section 2(9) of the Act) a<br />
transaction or an arrangement where a property is<br />
transferred to, or is held by, a person, and the<br />
consideration for such property has been provided, or<br />
paid by, another person; and the property is held for<br />
the immediate or future benefit, direct or indirect, of<br />
the person who has provided the consideration. There<br />
are four exceptions to this rule. The first is in respect<br />
of a karta or a member of a Hindu undivided family<br />
holding the property for the benefit of the family. The<br />
second exception is in respect of a person standing in<br />
a fiduciary capacity holding the property for the<br />
benefit of another person towards whom he stands in<br />
such capacity. The third exception is in the case of an<br />
individual who purchases the property in the name of<br />
his spouse or child, the consideration being provided<br />
or paid out of the known sources of the individual.<br />
The fourth exception is in the case of purchase of<br />
property in the name of brother or sister or lineal<br />
ascendant or descendant where the names of such<br />
brother or sister or lineal ascendant or descendant, as<br />
the case may be, and the individual appear as joint<br />
owners in any document. Sub-section (1) of Section 3<br />
contains the very same prohibition as under the<br />
unamended Act, in that it prohibits all benami<br />
transactions. Section 4 likewise prohibits suits, claims<br />
or actions or defences based on the plea of benami as<br />
in the case of the unamended Act. The submission is<br />
that under this scheme of law, step-daughter not<br />
having been defined under the Benami Act, but having<br />
been defined under the Income Tax Act, 1961, by<br />
virtue of sub-section (31) of Section 2 of the amended<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(158 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
Benami Act, the meaning of the expression will be the<br />
one assigned to it under the Income Tax Act. The<br />
definition of daughter under the Income Tax Act<br />
admits of a step-child within it. It is submitted that<br />
under the amended definition of &#8220;benami transaction&#8221;,<br />
thus, there is a clear exception in respect of a<br />
purchase made in the name of a step-daughter by an<br />
individual provided, of course, the consideration has<br />
been provided or paid out of known sources of the<br />
individual.<br />
7. What is crucial here is, in the first place, whether<br />
the change effected by the legislature in the Benami<br />
Act is a matter of procedure or is it a matter of<br />
substantial rights between the parties. If it is merely a<br />
procedural law, then, of course, procedure applicable<br />
as on the date of hearing may be relevant. If, on the<br />
other hand, it is a matter of substantive rights, then<br />
prima facie it will only have a prospective application<br />
unless the amended law speaks in a language &#8220;which<br />
expressly or by clear intention, takes in even pending<br />
matters.&#8221;. Short of such intendment, the law shall be<br />
applied prospectively and not retrospectively.<br />
8. As held by the Supreme Court in the case of R.<br />
Rajagopal Reddy v. Padmini Chandrasekharan (1995)<br />
2 SCC 630, Section 4 of the Benami Act, or for that<br />
matter, the Benami Act as a whole, creates<br />
substantive rights in favour of benamidars and<br />
destroys substantive rights of real owners who are<br />
parties to such transaction and for whom new<br />
liabilities are created under the Act. Merely because it<br />
uses the word &#8220;it is declared&#8221;, the Act is not a piece of<br />
declaratory or curative legislation. If one has regard<br />
to the substance of the law rather than to its form, it<br />
is quite clear, as noted by the Supreme Court in R.<br />
Rajagopal Reddy, that the Benami Act affects<br />
substantive rights and cannot be regarded as having a<br />
retrospective operation. The Supreme Court in R.<br />
Rajagopal Reddy also held that since the law nullifies<br />
the defences available to the real owners in<br />
recovering the properties held benami, the law must<br />
apply irrespective of the time of the benami<br />
transaction and that the expression &#8220;shall lie&#8221; in<br />
Section 4(1) or &#8220;shall be allowed&#8221; in Section 4(2) are<br />
prospective and apply to the present (future stages)<br />
as well as future suits, claims and actions only. These<br />
observations clearly hold the field even as regards the<br />
present amendment to the Benami Act. The<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(159 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
amendments introduced by the Legislature affect<br />
substantive rights of the parties and must be applied<br />
prospectively.”<br />
89. It is also a fact that an SLP instituted against the opinion<br />
(supra), has also been declined by the Supreme Court on 28th<br />
April, 2017 in Special Leave to Appeal (C) No. 12328/2017.<br />
90. In the case of Mohar Singh (supra), the Apex Court of the<br />
land dealt with the consequences of repeal of the Act. The<br />
question in the case of Zile Singh (supra), was related to<br />
disqualification from being a member of Municipal Council (if<br />
children were more than two). Thus, there was no violation of any<br />
fundamental right or penal consequence contemplated. Hence, the<br />
principles cannot be applied to the controversy raised in the<br />
instant batch of writ applications. Similarly, in the case of<br />
Yogendra Kumar Jaiswal (supra), the observations made by the<br />
Apex Court of the land while dealing with the issue of confiscation<br />
or attachment of money/property that was acquired illegally and<br />
that too at an interim stage of prosecution.<br />
91. In the case of Titaghur Paper Mills Co. Ltd. and Ors.<br />
(supra), the matter that fell for consideration of the Supreme<br />
Court, was with regard to ultra vires/jurisdiction of Sales Tax<br />
Officer and no question of law was involved therein.<br />
92. In the case of Gujarat Ambuja Cement Ltd. and Ors.<br />
(supra), while dealing with scope and ambit of writ application<br />
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the Supreme Court<br />
observed that what is to be ensured before entertaining such an<br />
application is that a strong case is made out and there exists no<br />
ground to interfere in extra-ordinary jurisdiction. It was further<br />
(D.B. SAW/839/2018 has been filed in this matter. Please refer the same for further orders)<br />
(Downloaded on 15/07/2019 at 07:47:06 PM)<br />
(160 of 160) [CW-2915/2019]<br />
observed that where under a statute there is an allegation of<br />
infringement of fundamental right or when on the undisputed facts<br />
the Taxing Authorities are shown to have assumed jurisdiction<br />
which they do not possess, can be the grounds for entertaining<br />
writ application. To the same effect is opinion of the Supreme<br />
Court in the case of Harbanslal Sahnia and ors.(supra).<br />
93. For the reason aforesaid and in the backdrop of the settled<br />
legal proposition so also in view of singular factual matrix of the<br />
matters herein; this Court has no hesitation to hold that the<br />
Benami Amendment Act, 2016, amending the Principal Benami<br />
Act, 1988, enacted w.e.f. 1st November, 2016, i.e. the date<br />
determined by the Central Government in its wisdom for its<br />
enforcement; cannot have retrospective effect.<br />
94. It is made clear that this Court has neither examined nor<br />
commented upon merits of the writ applications but has<br />
considered only the larger question of retrospective applicability of<br />
the Benami Amendment Act, 2016 amending the original Benami<br />
Act of 1988. Thus, the authority concerned would examine each<br />
case on its own merits keeping in view the fact that amended<br />
provisions introduced and the amendments enacted and made<br />
enforceable w.e.f. 1st November, 2016; would be prospective and<br />
not retrospective.<br />
95. The batch of writ applications stands disposed off, as<br />
indicated above.<br />
96. A copy of this order be placed in each of the file.<br />
